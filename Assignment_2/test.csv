478,McAlister's Deli,29.94967,-90.064408,16.0,I at there twice in the last week.  The Deli is located in Harrah's casino. The food was great as usual and the served in a very timely manner.  I would recommend that they provide more butter and sour cream with their Max Spud.
3490,The Soup Garden,29.9225193135,-90.0910877151,20.0,"The soup is good however it's not $8.50 good.  I would understand the pricing if the portion size was larger but the portion size is about the same as a dine in restaurant except this is a soup booth on a sidewalk.    If the soup was priced lower, I would eat here everyday."
2705,The Station Coffee Shop & Bakery,29.9785491138,-90.10292608290001,17.0,"Friendly, personable service. Kept a quick flow despite a busy crowd. Love the light and welcoming space. Best dirty chai in town! We'll be back!"
1973,Key West Hat Company,29.9550358,-90.0643574,17.0,"I love hats. I probably have 20 of them. But I still love buying them.   The collection here is quite extensive. I have been looking for this one hat style for a long time. But I found the one there. They design and make some of their own styles so quite some gems in there. The price range is also extensive, all the way from $20 to $100, you will find the hat you like and can afford.  They also have great music you just want to dance to and great customer service. They leave you alone if you just want to try hats and answer questions if you have any.   Would come back here again if I am back to NOLA."
369,Lengua Madre,29.9381171545,-90.0703308737,0.0,This is exactly what I want in a dining experience - great food on a journey through plates with guidance from the chef. Expect no menu and just a great experience and great service. It is the best.
1321,Mikimoto,29.962334625900002,-90.1132959741,3.0,"Very fresh, wonderful selection. Great lunch for a reasonable price. Place is small but the sushi is delicious!"
1580,Crescent City Vape Marigny,29.968418699999997,-90.0548083,19.0,"My favorite vape shop is now in the Marigny even closer to where I work. Same great people but the shop is bigger with a huge selection of CBD and hemp products. Wanted to try some new juice. Naked100 berry belts was recommended by Patrick and it is delicious. I love this juice. He was the friendliest salesperson I've encountered in a while and we just chilled and chatted for a while before I even knew what I was gonna buy. I also picked up some JUUL pods, they have all the flavors and they're regularly in stock. Super clean look to this new shop, I'm excited to see their expansion, I heard about a pop up CBD store coming in there soon. Awesome spot. Welcome to the neighborhood! Yet another awesome addition to such a cool part of town holler at st Claude!!!"
388,Lenis Restaurant,29.947087899999996,-90.074184,17.0,"After several days of indulgence in the great city of New Orleans, we were craving some simple food. This little old-fashioned lunch counter absolutely hit the spot. The smoked sausage sandwich, dressed with mayo, lettuce and tomato was garlicky and yummy. The hubby had red beans, rice and beef stew. He was silent throughout the meal, just enjoying the home-style food and finished up by soaking up the left-over gravy with some soft white bread. Less than 20 bucks for the both of us. A bargain in this town."
3033,Uptown Needle & CraftWorks,29.9203663,-90.1041521,19.0,Wonderful fabric and needlework shop. They sell fabric by the yard including Alexander Henry fabrics. Group and individual classes are offered. I highly recommended the shop owner Emma sewing classes.
3152,Uglesich Restaurant & Bar,29.942128399999998,-90.0767023,11.0,"We left New Orleans 17 years ago. Ate at Uglesich twice a month for years. The last night in town, my mentor, rented the restaurant for a party for my send off. It was the perfect end to a wonderful time. We ate the whole menu, and there were three mounted NOLA PD guards on the corner to get us to our cars. Mr Tony and Ms Gail could not have worked any harder to bring the best fresh seafood to New Orleans and we all were the better for their labor. Yes, i did go back to be there for their last lunch."
1175,The Revival Outpost,29.954074996,-90.0667727399,18.0,"A vintage store that can easily be housed in Los Angeles-- there were definitely a few things I wanted-- a cute purse that reminded me of Mary Poppins' carpet bag, oxford shoes one size too small, and a sweater that I had to put back due to the weather.  Definitely a store to visit if you're a vintage scavenger, and the prices weren't bad."
1811,Floor & Decor,29.9259773,-90.0831626,20.5,Great prices and wonderful design help!  Lindsay has helped me design and purchase the tile and supplies I needed for several bathrooms.  Her taste is spot on and she couldn't be more helpful or wonderful to work with.  Go here before you go to the West Bank store; you won't be sorry you did!  It won't cost you any more AND the service is EXCELLENT!
130,Maple Street Patisserie et Bistro,29.962469818200002,-90.1176114916,15.0,"Great Latte, fabulous muffins and delicious sandwiches!!  Small but sweet, location is off the beaten path but worth the trip."
1114,A to Z Framing,30.016627000000003,-90.05661409999999,17.0,"Let's say you need some framing done.  Let's further consider you want to support a local business in the heart of Gentilly.  Well, here ya go!  Karen and Allen are a husband and wife team that make framing an art with a fair price, a keen eye, and consistent level of service that is unparalleled.  They do it all from mounting to shadowboxes to frame restoration.  And they'll pick up and drop off too.  Yes, they are in the heart of Gentilly and it did flood pretty badly here.  So finding them and where they are may surprise you, as they are the only returned business at their intersection.  To be sure, ask around, this is where producing artists get their things framed, this is where galleries - like Julia St galleries - go too.    A to Z is the proverbial diamond of a frame shop in the rough of Gentilly."
3226,Mid City Seafood & Deli,29.982113599999998,-90.071438,21.0,I loved the crawfish! omg! Not too spicy just right! I will return to Mid City. They need to open a restaurant on the Westbank. Call it Algiers Seafood.
2000,30/90 NOLA,29.962866273600003,-90.0578663934,4.0,"Wow, I've been coming to NOLA for over 20 years and this was my first trip to Frenchmen St. I was not disappointed!!!  Great live music, very CLEAN bar with the best pizza I've ever had!!!  Not a huge menu, but if you want great music in a comfy place away from the crazy crowd, THIS IS IT!!!"
1715,Congo Square Coffee House,29.961456800000004,-90.06732290000001,17.0,Spent a small fortune on two of the worst mocha's I've ever had. The free foldgers in our hotel lobby would have been better. Super nice ladies and the pastries were good but terrible coffee.
3559,Tulane Ave Bar & Grill,29.967546999999996,-90.1026946,2.5,"Best bartenders! Cheap drinks, good company, and WHEELCHAIR ACCESSIBLE including the  spacious and fancy bathroom :)"
1068,Rubensteins,29.952758000000003,-90.069137,18.0,I've gotten something here on all my trips to NOLA over the years. Still some of my favorite clothes today.
2154,Ruby Slipper Cafe,29.925837100000003,-90.082574,16.0,Our waitress was so sweet and friendly. Made me feel right at home like I was a regular. Super fun options and cute little place on the corner.
649,Sentiments Wine and Cheese Dive,29.964024,-90.051491,1.5,"What an awesome place. Total hidden gem - and i mean hidden! You pull up outside of Feelings and likely are taken aback by how shabby the outside looks. There were no visible signs of Sentiments anywhere that we could see. So - we ventured inside. A super nice man greeted us and told us we were in the right place - just needed to head upstairs. I must say - the exterior does neither Feelings nor Sentiments any justice (Yelpers are right - what names!!?!*!). Very cool - both places. Kind of French country meets shabby chic.  We kept wondering where the heck a balcony would be as we trekked up this dark staircase, but voila! It's all interior magic -- narrow walkway with cute little 2-top tables along the railing - looking down into Feelings courtyard. Music seranades yiu as you hear the relaxing sounds of Feelings' fountain. One of the co-owners greeted us - hooked us up with a pretty good Nappa cab -- which was made instantly fantastic by the introduction of a fabulous cheese plate! We chose the 3-cheese option and let the expert do the choosing. He and his co-owner wife had lived in Nice, and some of that magic came back with them. He asked what we didnt like, what we preferred - and ohlala - the choices and accoutrements were fanbloodytastic...a pungent cows milk cheese wrapped in spruce and washed in local beer; a garlicky cows milk - very softy and creamy; and an aged Gouda (husband and i buy this regularly - yum!!). Candied pecans, sugared walnuts, cornichons, and Castellanos (?? the bright green ones) olives came alongside - and some scrumptious, perfectly-cooked fresh french bread. Heaven!!!! So relaxing. SO charming. Husband-wife duo apparently also teach French lessons along with a wine tasting. What a combo! This place is a total diamond find. Will definitely be back. Merci bien!!  Oh - and how cool - there appears to be a great yoga place right next door. Gotta come back for THAT!"
1126,Fritzel's European Jazz Pub,29.9593348,-90.06520640000001,4.0,"Excellent music, great cocktails.   Seating was a little tight, but at least you can take a seat with great proximity to awesome performances."
2159,Piece Of Meat,29.971259999999997,-90.09135400000001,18.0,This is the best sandwich shop and butcher in town. Corned beef. Brisket. Bologna. And Leighann is the best.
216,MyEyeDr,29.942582654899997,-90.13413794719999,17.5,"This place is highly overpriced with poor, even hostile service.  Frames here are marked up well above other shops and lenses are extremely expensive.  They took over two weeks to fill a prescription for new glasses, which is longer than anywhere I've ever experienced.  The eye exams are very quick, but perhaps too quick: my eyes had to be re-examined and one lens replaced because of blurred vision with those made to match the prescription.  Unfortunately, they are one of the only places left that takes my insurance.  I cannot recommend them."
2550,Mick's Irish Pub,29.9814062,-90.10620820000001,4.0,"By far my favorite bar in Mid City. Far better than Finns in my opinion. It's a great, relaxed neighborhood joint with great bartenders (Irene always makes sure I have a good night. Sometimes an even better night than I was planning :) ).   Hang out in the bar area where you first walk in, or journey up the few stairs into the back area with tables and couches to hang out with your friends. Either way you will have a good time at Micks.   I'm very happy to live near Micks and will be terribly sad to lose it if I were to ever have to move away from Mid City."
24,Mr. B's Bistro,29.9543868,-90.06836290000001,16.0,"In a word... ""OVERRATED!"".  The food took forever to come out.  The burger was WAY overcooked (Especially when I ordered it Medium Rare) and the Seafood Jumbalaya was Decent.  Not worth the price.  There are better places to eat in the french quarter.  It was not horrible, but for everything that we had heard about this place, I would have expected much better."
2736,Burger King,29.956225099999997,-90.11957153680001,14.0,"By now you've probably noticed that I've given this Burger King a one star rating. Let me preface the following review by saying this: I love Burger King. I love it so hard. This one star rating is NOT for the type of food, the way it's prepared, or the how healthy it is. Because it's delicious. Burger King is a godsend, handed down to man from the heavens above and I will continue to eat it long after the FDA inevitably discovers that it's the cause of all human pain and suffering.  Having said that, I'm giving this Burger King a one star rating for how terrible the service is at this particular location. I know what you're thinking and no, I'm not crazy. I don't expect a lot from fast food restaurants. I'm not asking for a maitre d' to escort me to a private white table clothed booth for one while I dine on Chicken Fries accompanied only by the sounds of my own heavy breathing. I'm not even asking for the employees to smile when they pretend to give a fuck about my extra BBQ sauce packets. All I ask is that when I order drive-thru you DON'T ASK ME TO PULL AROUND AND WAIT BY THE DOUBLE DOORS.  Let me get this straight. You have two drive-thru windows. The first one is never used. Every time I've ever ordered food you tell me to pull up to the second window. After I've ordered and payed you tell me to pull up and wait in the parking lot and someone will walk my food to me. Why not just use the first window for payment so by the time I get to the second window my food is waiting for me? Just like EVERY OTHER FAST FOOD FUCKING RESTAURANT EVER???!!*_#)Y&!!!!?????!!??##@$??  What a giant ""fuck you"" to your customers to be a fast food restaurant that can't give me my shitty food through the little window the way God intended it. It's not like you're cooking it.  And I know why you're doing it, Burger King. It's because your corporate headquarters keep track of how long it takes cars to leave the drive-thru window. I'm assuming the lowest times get rewarded for their fast service. I hope you're happy pissing off your continually loyal customers.  Someone get me a McRib."
3467,Sweet Things and Grill,29.9266302944,-90.02623425040001,0.0,"Great hot breakfast spot & the donuts are amazing. I see negative comments about how ""unprofessional"" the workers seem to be. First of all, don't go in there with your ""uppity expectations"". I just see a place that sells great food with a lot of room for improvement. This is not Ruth's chris people! This is a breakfast spot. The workers a real people just trying to make a successful business. Lighten up!"
3361,Dijon,29.936341,-90.069633,2.0,"I can't help but rave about the amazing food at Dijon!!  A bunch of us went for New Year's Eve dinner and the food and ambiance were both stellar.  It was a hard call between ordering off the regular menu or ordering off the New Year's Tasting Menu.  In the end, the grilled hangar steak won over the tasting menu.  A friend and I shared a cheese plate and the roasted oysters as starters.  I enjoyed bubbly by the glass but finished with a nice, well rounded Tuscan red with the steak...yum yum.  I would like to give a shout out the tuna dish from the tasting menu.  It was a creative and delicious treat.  I would have never guessed that cinnamon, tuna, pumpkin and pomegranate combo danced in my mouth.  Happy New Year!!"
1431,1135 Decatur,29.9605717,-90.05942850000001,6.0,"Cool bar I love the music they play, especially on Friday nights, bar is very goth in decor , somewhat dark, but very cozy. Drinks are good , and the bartenders are friendly."
1159,The Jimani,29.953509999999998,-90.06754699999999,8.0,Came to New Orleans to visit and looking for a place to watch the UFC fights was not easy. This place had the fights on with no cover charge! Some of the reviews said that the bartenders were rude but I would disagree. The two bartenders were awesome! They were direct and you better know what you want. But the more I hung out there the more I loved it! Awesome local bar. I would definitely go back. Food was ok. We got the pizza. Go there for the beer
2387,Jimmy J's Cafe,29.953128000000003,-90.06793,16.0,I got the blueberry glazed toast where they make their own house blueberry syrup and my partner got the captain crunch french toast with the pepper sausage parties.  It was a win win with great service from Zach and Leslie!    A must go.  Super delish
2482,El Taco Loco,29.947220013699997,-90.13034999370001,18.0,Nice place with friendly service. I had the shrimp tacos with pico and cilantro. Tortillas were grilled which is a nice touch and the pico was very flavorful. My only gripe is mini shrimp were used for the tacos. I was hoping regular/fresh shrimp would be used.   Next time I'll try a burrito since the beans and rice looked really good.
1317,Koz's Lakeview,30.0052147,-90.1098502,18.0,"After hearing some good things about Koz's from some friends and family my girlfriend and I decided to venture on over to Lakeview and check them out.   The first thing I noticed was the politeness of the staff. Even though Koz's is your typical po-boy and hot plate lunch/dinner menu it's always nice when your a first timer to be walked through it and have some of the more popular customer selections pointed out to you. Everything looked and sounded delicious and I was really intrigued by the ability to order a po-boy in either 8"", 12"", whole loaf, or 4"" toast (really like the idea of whole loaf for game day parties next Saints season). The salad selections on the menu are enough in my opinion to satisfy light eaters and vegetarians alike and the hot plate lunches and dinners include red beans and rice all the way down to seafood plates. Koz's also a decent amount of side items and daily specials to choose from.   After a few minutes of looking things over my girlfriend and I decided to bypass the po-boys this time around and each order a seafood plate that comes with two sides. I went with the fried oyster plate with the vegetable of the day (green beans) and a side salad and she went with the fried shrimp plate with baked macaroni and onion rings. Everything came out hot and fresh and in a timely manner. The oysters and shrimp were a very nice size and my girlfriend said that the baked macaroni was killer (which was obvious since it was gone in no time from her plate).   All in all when you consider the quality of the food and service we received and the affordability of our meal I would say that our first trip to Koz's was a success. We will definitely be coming back to have lunch or dinner and try out one of the po-boys on the menu."
1848,Irish Cultural Museum of New Orleans,29.957433,-90.06918979999999,14.0,"Matthew rolled out the red carpet for us!  We stopped while he was hosing down the courtyard and explained about the Irish coming into NOLA(which we had no idea about)  and let us explore the Museum and then we enjoyed meeting him back at the cafe... having a couple delicious drinks!  This may be a small venue, but it is MOST to stop !!"
49,Pizza Hut,30.026760200000002,-89.9933138,3.5,"Ordered online. And pizza was ready upon arrival, 15 minutes later as ordered.  Lite sauce as specified.   The price was right and placing the online order was easy-peasy!!!!!  We were happy.   We were able to pull up, pick up the order and keep it moving.   Thanks to the manager that was helping to keep the flow moving!!!! Yay and yay!!!!   Happy. Happy. Joy. Joy."
3171,Country Flame,29.953893,-90.067832,17.0,I would describe this place like a fart in church - not appropriate at any time.  The food was just bad.
172,Cafe Pontalba,29.957225266,-90.0638432191,17.0,"The food here was good, but nowhere near competes with other restaurants in the French Quarter. We wandered in because we couldn't find anywhere else.   It's unclear how you're supposed to find a table, but customers are just supposed to grab a table. There's a sort-of line that forms by the bar, but no one working there organizes it at all.  We sat down quickly, but I think it was just lucky timing because for the rest of our meal people were waiting to sit. Also, there's only one bathroom and it took FOREVER to use it. They seriously need to have more than just one bathroom.  I ordered the crab cakes florentine, which were really good. The potatoes needed more spice (aka hot sauce) but the meal was really flavorful. The chef cooked the eggs perfectly, but there was nothing to scoop up the runny egg with since there was no bread. My friend ordered the french toast and it was not impressive. Just a few slices of bread with cinnamon and some egg on top. Not filling or visually stunning.   Our waitress was not particularly nice and seemed angry with us when we didn't want to order drinks. Many people did seem to have their food and then get a drink to-go as they walked around Jackson Square.   I'd say you should go here if you're really hungry and can't find anywhere else. But otherwise, skip it and do the research for a better place."
3452,Cafe Navarre,29.989478100000003,-90.1080328,16.0,"Great atmosphere. Quality foods and interesting twists on brunch favorites. Try the Eggs Blackstone, a different take on Eggs Benedict. The grilled tomato has wonderful flavor."
2754,Lilette,29.921956199999997,-90.09276609999999,2.0,"We ate dinner here on Oct. 29, 2014.  This restaurant, on Magazine Street in the antique/boutique area of Uptown, came highly recommended.  I was in a quandary giving this restaurant three stars, because it was two different experiences: the food was a four, but the atmosphere was a two, at best.  The service was just ordinary for such an expensive restaurant.  The best description I can give is Lilette is ""dining out"" at a very good restaurant, but it is not what I'd consider fine dining.  The wine list was among the worst I've ever encountered, with only the most expensive (and overpriced) selections.  Not a single moderately priced and good quality bottle of wine on the list. Not everyone wants to spend $200+ on a bottle of wine, but those wines dominate the list. The restaurant seating is one large room with nothing to block the noise, which was substantial.  This is NOT a place for a romantic dinner.  For the money, I'd stick with the fine dining options closer to the French Quarter."
3374,The White Roach,29.921341700000003,-90.1182071,15.0,"While the name is unappealing, the shop itself is delightful.  Like Katie, I was drawn into this shop by the $2 record bin. Surprisingly, there were a lot of good picks here. I'm not a record collector (I have my mom's old records, but alas no player), but I have quite a few friends who are. Along with a nifty selection of $2 records, inside there is a whole box dedicated to New Orleans artists. I found some goodies from Pete Fountain, Allen Toussaint and others. They also have a nice selection of cassette tapes.  They carry a few pieces of clothing- there are some vintage concert and band shirts for sale, but the clothing is more of an afterthought to the record collection."
2221,Cafe Beignet - St. Peter,29.958185999999998,-90.06514200000001,16.0,"Really friendly gentleman assisting me today.  I was greeted with a smile, very welcoming and prompt."
1486,Silk Road,29.9650322,-90.05192650000001,3.0,YUMMY! I love indian food and I love New Orleans food...so I was in heaven. It's spicy and flavorful. The samosas and the lentil soup was my favorite. I am looking forward to trying the poboys. Wine tasting on Thursdays is a nice touch. I will be back!
786,Courtyard Brewery,29.940038,-90.07190899999999,18.0,The Vanilla Porter was quite good.  The atmosphere was nice if not quaint.  The urban music choose was odd for the guest.  The bar tender was VERY dry and unfriendly.. what a shame as she cost the 2 stars from five....shame... we left....
1539,O'Henry's Food & Spirits,29.943853100000002,-90.1337477,17.0,"Place was grimey. Service for lunch on a weekday was slow and terrible. We were forgotten about multiple times, people who sat way after us getting drinks and food first. We left after one cocktail. Not the place to be."
313,El Cucuy,29.9182985,-90.0895163,18.0,"Loved the food and it was inexpensive! The outdoor seating is so cute! Unfortunately, I can't say the same for the service... I understand things are tough during COVID. However, it was not packed and they're a new restaurant... I figured they'd want to be nice to their customers who were nothing but polite. But most of the staff was rude. One person at our table was given her food 50 minutes after us and when she had asked about it and they told her it was coming in 2-3 minutes. It did not come out for another 20 minutes. On top of that my order was messed up and so was hers. They were not even apologetic about it... Also an automatic 20% tip is charged to your account."
304,Vintage 329,29.9554828,-90.0672408,19.0,"Buyer Beware!  I visited this store when they were called Vintage 429 in 2003. I bought a signed  Nirvana poster with a COA stating money back if not authentic. We this past week I found out the poster is fake. The COA was signed by the co-owner of Vintage 329. When I called the store this past weekend, they wanted nothing to do with my complaint and were completely unsympathetic. 1200 dollars down the drain. Just because they changed their name, their name is still on my COA. I sent them an email message via their website and have been ignored up to this point."
475,Cleaver & Co,29.9290256757,-90.09744098690001,19.0,"Support this place. Support this place! Support this place!! Don't make me have to repeat myself. This place is doing it right, quality product, local sourcing, old-school service. Prices are also reasonable."
1145,Blue Line Sandwich,29.9499788,-90.0748774,18.0,"So the duck and Mushroom gumbo was one of the best gumbo's that I have ever tasted. It's packed with flavor. The tea that are fresh and Blue Line offers a good selection of tea flavors. Our office also ordered catering and again, surprise, the wraps - salad - gumbo were delish and everything was fresh and filling. The customer service is one of the best that I have received since being out in New Orleans. Highly recommended!!!"
3239,Spice Bar & Grill,29.9843855,-90.0710772,5.0,"Bad neighbor, no parking!  These dirtbags and their low life patrons park illegally everywhere and litter our neighborhood.  We'll be taking pictures to add to our reviews (and send to the City) so you can see what poor neighbors they are.  Please do not support this business."
3262,Funky Monkey,29.9243554,-90.0861573,20.0,"I've been to Funky Monkey more than once, and stopped by there again today. Most times I don't buy anything because their stuff is way overpriced. When I do buy, it's usually jewelry that I can take apart and turn into other jewelry. I rarely buy anything else here. Today was THE FIRST TIME (I've lived in NOLA almost ten years) that someone in the store greeted me when I walked in. Usually the kids who work here are too cool for school. I'll continue to drop by every now and then, because sometimes you can find a bargain in here, but just know this: Funky Monkey is not a ""thrift"" store. Most things here are overpriced by a good bit because they know they can get away with it. Finding a steal every now and then is possible, but don't count on it."
2067,Rabbit Ears,29.9484673711,-90.13107955950001,20.0,"I bought three items from this store, two new and one used item. I tried to haggle down two bucks, and I ended up mortally offending the salesperson. Well, crap. She then mocked me for spending so little, which hurt my feelings. Seventeen bucks is a lot of money when you're recovering from cancer. Oh well, it was still a cute place with funky junk. Maybe she's having money troubles and it's stressing her out. I left feeling like dirt, though.   Here's why the one star: You'll never get the stench out of the items you buy. I tried. Nope, they still stink. Gross."
737,Vucinovich's Restaurant,30.029995,-89.92781,17.0,"My husband and I are driving to Florida and stopped here for lunch. We got the special: gumbo, gulf shrimp, catfish and fries. It was reasonably priced and the food was amazing! Would definitely stop here again!"
1239,Remoulade,29.955719300000002,-90.0684542,8.0,"Remoulades is great for getting good and well priced food on Bourbon. My husband and I usually go when friends are in town who want to stay on bourbon street. The food is good, and I have enjoyed many dishes from this kitchen.  The jambalaya is tasty and you can definitely split most of these plates because they are very large.  They have many Cajun food options that will leave you satisfied.   The staff has always been friendly and the wait time is nothing. You receive your food in a timely manner.   The food is not high quality but like I said it's good, not great. I would definitely recommend this restaurant if you're looking for a nice meal in the hustle and bustle of bourbon street."
448,Gelato Pazzo Caffe,29.947786600000004,-90.1300849,12.5,"After a nice lunch on a Thursday afternoon, a friend and I wandered down the street for some gelato. Actually, she wanted it, I didn't.  When we walked in we couldn't help but get excited by how cute the decor was. Bright, colorful and outside seating, which is always a plus for me.  I didn't even really want any when we went in, but when I saw (and tasted) the blood orange sorbetto, I just couldn't help myself. It was wonderful.  I don't know about other people's customer service experience, but I had a great one. We were greeted when we came through the door and the lady seemed happy to allow us to try whatever we wanted. I even asked why it was that I could plow through a pint of ice cream with no problem, but a scoop of gelato would get me nice and full. She explained to me the differences, and how gelato was denser and therefore more fulfilling.  I see that they also have other food too, so I will probably to heading over there to check them out for lunch one day."
440,Catty Car Corner,29.951039,-90.0773412,17.0,Not fancy but reliable affordable and a friendly staff. Plate lunch selection changes daily. Shrimp Poboys are always available. BLTs and clubs make for a big lunch. I eat there often and recommend it.
2753,Plush Appeal,29.970502500000002,-90.0858469,17.0,"When you are riding in a Krewe for Mardi Gras, you must go to Plush Appeal for their many selections of what I like to call ""Bulk Beads."" Their prices can not be beat if your goal is to get as many beads as you possibly can for your ride. I usually buy my bulk beads here, (which are your average purple, green, and gold beads in varying sizes.)   They do have discounts for those that are riding in certain krewes, and their plush selection is pretty darn good, hence the name! I usually get my bulk beads and garter belts for St. Patty's day here, so they are pretty good shop. I will continue to come here as long as I am riding, which I hope to do for the very long future!"
3431,Tequila Blues,29.960588399999995,-90.0592631,18.0,"Went to this establishment on a Monday a few weeks back due to El Gat Negro being closed. A huge mistake on my part. There was only my table of two and one other table during lunch hours and it still took our waitress too long to check on us. Too busy on the phone texting to wait on her table. The only expedient part of the service was the food, as most if not all of the meal was pre-prepared and microwaved upon order. The guacamole was rancid/mayo mixed and clearly out of a packaged bag. The ""house made"" tamales were dry and hardened. My friend's carne asada was gritty and over cooked.   I rarely ever review but in this occasion where the experience was as bad as the one I had, there is no choice but to voice the issues.  Please, management, it's not hard to cook delicious and authentic food TO ORDER. The penny pinching methods of buying frozen/bagged/processed inventory and to pre-cook your dishes will only cause an empty dining area."
2095,Metro Moving,30.0103282,-90.10254259999999,13.0,These guys were my heroes!!! They made my move very easy considering I have a broken arm!!! Not one broken glass or dish!! The assembled my bed better than I had previously had it!! They were punctual and professional!!! Once they arrived they never stopped working! It took not even two hours!! Oh and on the plus side the mover weren't too bad on the eyes!!!
137,Revival,29.9761075,-90.1021748,15.0,"I stopped in to see Chris while visiting from out of town. Simply put, awesome barber who gives an awesome haircut. Chris is really confident in his skill and gave me a perfect cut. The shop is really beautiful and clean and features some quality American made clothing.   On my five minute walk home I had two guys compliment my haircut. Definitely stop in."
2234,Cava,30.004888,-90.10596899999999,1.5,"Ate at Cava last night for the first time. Very nice! It was a little loud, the concrete floors and high ceiling don't absorb much noice, having a large party (2 busses large) didn't help the noice but that really didn't bother me. I'm just letting you know.   Service was great, John took a little longer to drop the check but was excellent every other step of the way.   Double cut pork chop, garlic mashed potatoes and green beans were flawless. Shrimp Carbonara as well. Christina even enjoyed the Rabbit Rhemy appetizer until she realized it actually was rabbit!   So 4 not 5 because the noise level, dessert was good not great and 5 minutes after we were finshished dessert and drinks we had to ask for the check. Service was great but not excellent. But a great experience I'd highly recommend!"
2388,Arabella Casa Di Pasta,29.931299,-90.073893,2.0,"Arabella's casa di pasta is located in the back of the tasting room and serves the best traditional, Italian pasta in New Orleans.   You pick the pasta that you want and they hand make it for you after you order it. Then, pair your pasta with one of their sauces - I'm told that the menu changes daily.  I ordered the spicy pork andouille meatballs as a starter and got the rigatoni with pork neck bone bolognese sauce. It was the best meal I've had in New Orleans since moving down here last year. I also paired my dinner with a recommended Tempranillo red from the tasting room next door.  I'll definitely be back again real soon."
963,Subway,29.953491182199997,-90.0685816871,16.0,"Rude!!!  When I walked in, the employee looked at me and walked into the kitchen for a while.  When she returned she said we only have wheat bread and are out of all other bread and continued to list all items they were out of and never looked at me.  When she was ready to wait on me, all I got was a stare.  I walked out."
742,Cloud Nine Bistro,29.923748100000005,-90.0861823,16.0,"The place is going hard for atmosphere, and it is cavernous and retro, with partially exposed brick walls. I got very attentive service while I was there, at an off-peak time. Their menu of waffles and other breakfast delights yielded for me a slightly caky waffle with nutella and bananas. The bananas were not fresh but had been sautéed or something beforehand; personally I find waffles (or pancakes/pastries/etc.) plenty crusty enough on their own and I much prefer the taste of fresh fruit on them. The waffle itself was a delicious indulgence. The syrup on the side didn't add much, surprisingly. All told, I was satisfied that I spent my unexpected break that day well.  I might try another fruitier option if I went back, and I'd also look in to the deals this place offers through Yelp."
402,Applebee's Grill + Bar,29.920053000000003,-90.01383100000001,16.0,"Good god. Waited atleast 15 min to even be acknowledged by the front door staff at this place. And the funny thing is that employees kept walking by (hint hint: you can at the very least tell the customer ""I'll be with you in a moment"") Had like 6 people in front of me waiting for the hostess so I should've known to run at this point but we stayed (partly because we had a hungry toddler). We were sat and the waitress actually seemed very nice and attentive at first. But then she didn't give us napkins. Or straws. Or silverware. Our food was placed infront of us by not our waiter and I asked that person for silverware (seems logical since food was just placed in front of me) She said okay and ran off. So then I didn't ask anyone else for it (don't want to seem rude- I trusted she would eventually come). After 5 min of my food getting cold I finally flagged down our waiter (who really didn't seem to care that she had only been to our table to take our order) and she took about another 5 min to get the silverware. Come on people. You have 1 job. Then I notice that what my dad ordered isn't what was put infront of him. They sent it back and got him the right thing. By the time he got his correct food- we were finished ours. Then to top it off they put the wrong order onto our bill. Luckily my dad checked but seriously the waiter still had only been to our table that 1 time to get our orders (and the brief set down of our silverware). This is crap service and the fact that my dad gave her 20% tip because of their retarded electronic tabletop cashier thingy is heartbreaking. Like you even got to rely on the mini iPad on the table to swipe your card. Why do they even have a waiter? Places like this and chilis have turned to garbage. Won't be back"

My husband and I spoke at length with the owner, Jann, who could not have been more kind or knowledgeable. Also, I'm pretty sure my fleur-de-lis earrings are turning the Saints season around! Highly recommend."
3310,Southern Costume Company,29.949228299999998,-90.07440140000001,18.0,"I found myself at Southern Costume Co. searching for something to wear in my Mardi Gras themed engagement photos and besides a few vague outlines of an idea, I was really searching for inspiration.  SCC did not fail to deliver.  The range and quality of costumes is really impressive.  The gentleman who helped me (alas, I cant remember his name!) was great, super knowledgeable with a good eye and SO laid back.  They let me peruse the stacks for as long as I wanted with no hassle, were super accommodating, reasonably priced and don't have a crazy urgent return policy, which if your gonna rent for a ball is nice.  Overall really great experience which I just wasn't expecting from a costume store right at the start of carnival."
1268,Burger King,30.0423786293,-89.95728832549999,17.0,I would never recommend anyone to get food from this establishment. I once ordered a mocha iced coffee from them and they gave me a mocha fray with a big goon of chocolate syrup on top. It was excruciatingly frustrating trying to explain that a mocha iced coffee is different from a mocha frap. The service is slow and it seems like no one goes there except for breakfast.

The atmosphere is very welcoming, accompanied with a in house DJ. The food was amazing, and the prices are beyond reasonable. I opted for the gumbo, and it felt like angels were dancing on my tongue. Niecey is very sweet! Thanks for the love NO!"
479,Stonefree Boutique,29.9489635962,-90.07484556440001,17.5,Best boutique in Nola! The staff is always so friendly and the clothing offered is unique and refreshing!! We always make sure to stop in and see what new goodies the amazing owner has picked! Love supporting an amazing small business!
3151,Party City,29.9592569381,-90.1846969128,18.5,"How could you not like a Party City? Especially when you live in a city known for parties?! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH My brain is exploding!  This is obviously a chain, there Is nothing that is going to be exciting other than the fact that everything in here is awesome and kitchy and gross and weird. We had to go in to pick up some liquid latex (like you do on a Wednesday afternoon). The only downside to this location was the fact that they had one person working in the whole store. WHAAAA?"

She fielded questions/billing from both me and my mother-in-law, she listened to what we wanted and she provided spot on!  The flowers were gorgeous!  She even flew in poppies for me so that I could have my favorite flower on our wedding day!  Could not be more impressed with the outcome and the service! Thank you thank you thank you!"
2141,Acorn,29.989942300000003,-90.0940571,18.0,"Delicious. The brussel sprouts were my favorite part, and I enjoyed the slice of the day which was some sort of chicken pizza. Loved the atmosphere which was kid and eco friendly."
1285,JIMS,29.9636825,-90.0470096,17.0,"I hesitate to write another good review for fear of encouraging too many people to try this gem of a restaurant.  Friendly and helpful service.  A beautiful egg white omelette with a fresh fruit side.  I had the special, a breakfast burger with ham, egg and cheese.  A large fresh patty on a good roll.  Only the undercooked, greasy fries prevented a five star rating."
189,McAlisters Select,29.949309352399997,-90.06531020979999,9.0,Used to be a go to for me. Tried to hit this one in the Harrah's Casino and it's the worst ever. Taking an hour to get food and getting it wrong almost each time. You'd do better to go to a hotdog vendor on the street. Sad times for this place. The franchise as a whole has fallen far from grace but this one takes the cake.
1570,The Rendezvous Tavern,29.9246243,-90.0856772,4.0,"I have a little bit of bad news for the recently converted AmEx carrying hipsters of DC:  Your ""dive bars"" in DC are not dive bars.  As a matter of fact, if you set one foot into a true dive like Rendezvous Tavern in New Orleans, you will be so appalled, not only at the non-9-dollar beer selection, but at the brazen service, the ""Mos Eisley"" Cantina crowd, and the lack of any serious provisions that you will probably storm out in a massive tantrum.  Oh well.  Otherwise, I really enjoyed Rendezvous Tavern.  I mean if you love cheap drinks, cool conversations, weird people, bitchy waiters, cigarette smoke flying all around, and the smell of stale beer look nowhere else.  It's a great meet up spot for day drinking, conversation, and even pre-gaming before setting off to some of the more hotter spots.  There is no pretending here - just plain and simple realities on the ground and being who you are.  Legendary."
2245,Balise Tavern,29.947676300000005,-90.0722131,3.0,"Four stars rather than five because: 1) The upstairs dining room is uncomfortably loud (I plugged my ears because I was experiencing physical pain when a crying baby was added to the already really loud din) and 2) The service from the kitchen was quite slow (appetizers took 30 minutes, dinner an hour). However, despite these hiccups, the actual service was attentive, our servers were lovely, and the food was delicious. The pickled quail eggs, while possibly overpriced, were completely adorable with a great presentation in a glass jar. I had mushroom soup that was rich and so delicious I didn't need an entree."
561,Liuzza's By The Track,29.9803209101,-90.08311791979999,18.0,"With the exception of JazzFest season, this a local's joint. Great gumbo, a stellar BBQ shrimp po' boy, duck tenders, and cold beer. It's worth the cab ride."
2930,Rotolo's Pizzeria,29.950074600000004,-90.0750188,17.0,"I'm rather surprised by such lousy reviews here.   I've eaten lunch at Rotolo's, picked up take out and ordered delivery.  Each time it was consistently good food with good service at a good price.  Was there anything mind blowing that I MUST go back for?  No, but its a chain pizzeria, I think that is to be expected.  However, it is two blocks from my office with a $6.99 salad and soup (their soups are pretty good) special, so I will be sure to return.   They also have a full bar, so it wouldnt be bad to grab a bite and drinks after work as well! Heres a B.O.B. (b*tch on a budget) tip, sign up for their email list and they'll email you a $5 off coupon!"
1799,The Big Cheezy,29.9621511,-90.0899002,18.0,"The sandwiches are delicious! I hate sandwiches but this place is awesome. I had the one with buffalo sauce I was thinking it would be too spicy for me, but it was prefect! My bf had the flying something and he really liked it. The tomato basil soup was yummy with the cheese in top and the waffle fries were delicious as well. I wish there was a place like this in Houston. I'd go here when I'm craving a cheesy sandwich all the time. Even tho it maybe out of the way and not in the FQ it is a great place to grab a quick lunch and they have their own parking lot which makes it easier since parking is a hassle in the FQ. I'll be back here for sure when I visit NOLA again!"
1433,Arnaud's Restaurant,29.9558322,-90.06865490000001,2.0,A total fucking joke. My grandparents lived in NO and I've been to Arnaud's enough times to tell you it should be closed. I was incredulous by the 3.5 rating but it should be a 1.0 and shuttered. There are so many killer places - don't waste your time on the old places. They are resting in their laurels and really are your grandmother's old and bad meals. Yuck.
271,West London Boutique,29.921084499999996,-90.0964856,17.0,"OMG!  Amazing customer service.  I ordered some dresses and pants from West London and what a treat!  The attention to detail in the packaging was great, a piece of dried eucalyptus and a handwritten note!  Mariah was so patient with me and made sure I got my money's worth.  I cannot wait to shop at West London again!  It's a return to the times of old....when purchasing a new dress was an event and customer Service and quality were top priorities!"
772,F & M Patio Bar,29.9168565,-90.10697409999999,7.0,"Last night was my first time over at F&M on Tchoup. The location makes it a little out of the way- i'm not sure how you would get there if you weren't going to shell out some extra cash for a cab (luckily, the boy drove). I say head on over for a night of dancing, it's worth it!  A great plus of this place is that everyone is so busy dancing that they don't have time to smoke- you can breathe in here!   The music is an eclectic mix of current rap/r&b, pop, and then some 80s/90s stuff. I actually heard a few wedding line dance type songs. F&M is actually a few different rooms all connected and last night they were playing different music in the different rooms. The bar was servings up wings and cheese fries and all types of things that smelled great.   I heard from a local that no one ends up here unless it's way into the early morning hours and they've had too much to drink.   I guess I don't understand why people are complaining about the scene here. Are you going out to pick up a new date? Or are you going out with your friends to dance and spend time together? Okay, so a few guys made some comments- just shake them off or smile and walk away! Maybe this isn't the place to meet new people...but I had fun.   F&M's offers a great time if you're looking for some fun dancing! It's all about your attitude :)"
1818,Peewee’s Crabcakes,29.945769399999996,-90.0879098,20.0,Horrible service. We stood at the counter for 15 minutes wanting on someone to acknowledge us. Then when my husband tried to get their attention they ignored him!!!!
254,Ali Baba,29.958311300000002,-90.06550859999999,5.0,"As a fan of the late night kabab, shwarma or gyro in nyc, I made a stop through Ali ba ba's on one occasion and ended up here again near the end of the trip as it hits the spot!  They are bigger in size of the ones I get in NYC and double the price ($6) but I can imagine the cost is a factor of limited demand (small lines) and pallets in NOLA for a gyro vs a po boy.  They only have rooster sauce for hot sauce which is a knock and they can be slow to serve but the gyros are better than the $5 slice next door or the $5+ lucky dogs on the corner."
3181,13 Monaghan,29.962952,-90.0575079,5.0,"Eating well in New Orleans is easy; eating well in New Orleans as a vegetarian is hard. This bar/restaurant is located in a hip, slightly off the beaten path and highlights the veggie food while having a bunch of meaty things for the carnivores.  BBQ tofu sandwich was excellent and much needed to keep the walking energy on a hot New Orleans summer day.  Looking forward to a return visit."
3038,Mona Lisa Restaurant,29.9621826,-90.06079140000001,2.0,"We called this place to see if they deliver. They said it would be an hour for delivery or just come here. So we went there 5 minutes later and they said, ""sorry not taking anyone else."" It was t even busy and it was a half hour before they closed. RUDE!"
1327,Freddie's Chicken N' Waffles,29.917899199999997,-90.0079056,15.5,"I've ordered take from this place about 8-10 times since they opened a few months ago. I've had their Chicken and Waffles, Meaty Peaty, Catfish Platter, Seafood Platter, Shrimp & Grits and their Red Beans and Rice entree'.   Everything I've had has been delicious even the way they prepare their eggs are great. Their Red Beans and rice are homemade and are my favorite dish that they serve. You can tell they cook those beans 5ish hours because they are so tender and flavorful that I really don't need any sausage with them even though they do give you enough sausage with it. You can get a smaller portion of the Red Beans and Rice as a side dish with their CatFish Platter, Seafood Platter and the BBQ Shrimp meal.   This place is much needed for our Algiers area."
1621,Louisiana Pizza Kitchen Uptown,29.943156199999997,-90.1335395,17.0,"Good for the Quatro Pizzia and the rosemary chicken pizza.  The vibe of the place is 1/2 tourist destination 1/2 neighbood pizza joint, they somehow kind of sort of work in a nice and stress free dining room."
1187,Pho Kang,29.9344953,-90.0805865,19.0,"Ordered through uber eats due to the fact I can't drive at the moment, I got the chicken banh mi, stir fried salmon, and Thai iced tea. The banh mi (sandwich) was ok it was not that good to me. I have had plenty is banh mi's back at home they were delicious but this one seemed more of an actual po' boy than a Banh mi. I don't know if it were the bread which threw me off. But the chicken was very bland...had no flavor. The cilantro was withered wasn't fresh and crunchy, no peppers were in my sandwich and the vegetable that were supposed to be pickled were mediocre. The Thai tea was delicious, and the stir fried salmon was pretty good although the carrots that came with that plate, tasted like they were spoiled and they were super soft. I had to spit it out. I was highly disappointed l lowkey feel like my money was wasted. Next time I'll try this other Vietnamese spot on the West Bank read the reviews they were pretty good. Would I go back? Issa no for me....but if I do I'll just order a Thai tea and keep it pushing. It's a hard pass for me."
787,Walgreens,30.0214234,-90.1127121,16.0,"Amid the many negative reviews of the pharmacy, I can attest that the grocery here is always tidy, well-stocked, and featuring many sale items. I've always like visiting Walgreen's for toiletries, and the Lakeview location has not failed me in that regard.   Granted, the pharmacy department staff are not impressive in the least. On repeated visits they have always performed extremely slow, and are almost entirely dismissive if a customer is just trying to purchase an item or two.   Maybe I'm mistaken, but I was always under the impression that the pharmacy was also fully operational as a checkout counter. If prescription medication is what you're looking for, do yourself the favor and go to the Charbonnet Pharmacy two blocks away."
3516,Rue De La Course,29.924049199999995,-90.086055,18.0,"Great coffee, a homey atmosphere, and a wait staff that would rather spit on you than serve you. What more could you want? One of the few coffee shops that I can actually study at, Rue de la Course has been a longtime friend of the gourmet coffee drinker. Just do yourself a favor and don't order the coffee shake. Oh, it's good...but the barrista may just gouge your eyes out before he/she makes it."
2645,Mondo,30.003791800000002,-90.1036594,3.0,The only thing that keeps this from being a five star rave is the noise level.  That should be easily fixable with some sound baffles.   We actually opted out the other night and went elsewhere because the noise was so loud.  BUT...the food is awesome and servers are great...we love Susan and will go as often as we can...but look for off hours if you want to have a conversation.  Ahhh the pimento cheese!
1050,Tavolino Pizza & Lounge,29.952136,-90.054537,16.5,"I was honestly a little skeptical since there are very few options near the ferry dock.  However, I was pleasantly surprised.  The service AND quality of the food were both EXCELLENT!  We tried the chef special pizza of the day and a couple of appetizers. Good wine and beer selection too.  Have a patio area in the back that was pretty chilled.  Note that they only open at 3pm ... we waited around for about 30 minutes for them to open and it was the right decision!"
1783,Dough to Dough,29.971959499999997,-90.0655531,20.0,"What a great place to eat! I just left earlier this morning and picked up 2 doughnuts and a brownie (all vegan). As I'm ordering the brownie, the worker tells me the new batch of brownies were coming out that moment and asked if I'd like a corner or middle piece. Fantastic! It's those little details that (when added with both great customer service and an awesome menu) really makes a business thrive and keep customers coming back. The service was wonderful and I strongly encourage anyone to come give this place a try. Finally! A place on the Westbank that caters to vegans and is very reasonably priced."
1200,Krystal,29.954235100000002,-90.06948,7.0,"My boyfriend and I fell in love with Krystal's tiny burgers as soon as we took our first bite.  It's absolutely yummy after a long night partying on Bourbon Street and still yummy as breakfast the next morning.  Yes, we had Krystal's twice in less than 8 hours!  That's how much we loved it!  They practically melt in your mouth.  I am fiending just thinking about them."

What a great place to relax after walking around the French Quarter and have you a sandwich. It is just like an old school Italian Grocery."
289,Big Shirley's,29.9863011,-90.07626040000001,17.0,"Great people, music, and food! I've had a few meals here and you can't go wrong!  Had the breakfast bowl (served in a foam cup) - this is the way to go.  Had the Gumbo and fried catfish for dinner. Another great choice. Made hot and fresh."
1884,Dickey's Barbecue Pit,29.941517053800002,-90.18894201239999,18.0,"I get the full rack of ribs for take out, always very goodn tender, fast and consistant, I get the sauce on the side, they have three types in their sauce station. I sometimes take home the pulled pork and make my own sandwiches, this is also very good. I have only been to the Jeff hwy location, the service has always been good."
3396,NOLA Couture,29.923060999999997,-90.087974,19.0,"This is an adorable shop that is perfect for the NOLA lover in your life.  I was here getting some Christmas gift ideas (8 weeks, y'all) and I found a lot of options. Not only do they have brightly colored ties and belts, for the man in your life, but they have cute necklaces that are stamped with NOLA neighborhoods, so you can represent where you're from. They also have glassware that is etched with streetcars, for a subtle nod to the city without being obnoxious. They also carry locally made makeup bags and other New Orleans themed gifts.  The woman working was extremely friendly and filled me in about all of the items I was looking at and I will be sure to return when I officially start my holiday shopping."
534,Double Dealer,29.954478,-90.072818,3.0,Wonderful new bar and lounge. Once you enter you walk downstairs and are welcomed by luxurious booths and a grand bar. If that bar is packed not to worry as there is another quaint gorgeous bar if you walk past the main bar. The love music takes you away as you enjoy your time if this wonderful space.
3466,High Hat Cafe,29.935093648800002,-90.10434171530001,17.0,"Wonderful atmosphere, great service, homemade condiments to go along with really yummy food! Love to hit this place up whenever I'm in the area."
2695,French Quarter Phantoms,29.960767399999998,-90.0680859,15.0,"We took the cemetery tour with Dylan and he was great! The price of the tour was totally reasonable and we were appropriately prepped for the heat that was August in New Orleans. Dylan kept the tour at a good pace and his stories were interesting and funny. He talked about the graves we visited expertly, but made sure to treat the graves and cultures with sensitivity in his stories. If I could give him a sixth star, I would!"
2752,Newton's Hot & Cold,29.9585520002,-90.0615679483,19.5,"A really sweet place (no pun intended!) They've only been open a few weeks. We stopped by one rainy afternoon and enjoyed the bread pudding with whiskey sauce. They also have sandwiches, soup and gelato. Lovely atmosphere."
3464,GameStop,29.949421,-90.181168,19.0,"One of the best Gamestops in the ""city"" The employees are helpful and are knowledgable about every game. Their game stock is also great. This has to be one of the larger of the stores in the company."
2967,Mid City Pizza Uptown,29.9470131,-90.1138142,10.5,This place is great! We live close by and eat here regularly. Pizza is always ready pretty quickly and tasty. It's the best we've found in the area so far. I definitely recommend!
2553,Crescent City Cigar Shop,29.9587909707,-90.06506236950001,19.0,Nice cigar lounge right off of the madness of Bourbon Street. Just a couple steps down and the sound and smell just sorta disappears. There are a bunch of cigar shops around but most are funky and just there to grab the money from tourists who don't smoke except for the bourbon street trip.  Crescent city isn't like that. There is actually a humidor with a pretty nice selection. Different than the stuff at home.  Armando gave me some good tips on what was a nice smoke.  Decided on a rocky patel.  Got it cut clean right there and fired it up.  Unfortunately the place was closing in about 15 min so I couldn't enjoy the sitting area and lounge and smoked it on the bourbon street walk.   Seemed like a nice place with a guy who cared about what I was there for.  If I lived here I'd for sure be here whenever I wanted a smoke.
637,Cajun Seafood,29.971198100000002,-90.0677061,18.0,"Horrible experience,  went off the 4* reviews, not even close. We had a man digging in the trash next to us, coughing and talking to himself. Made everything uncomfortable and the food un-enjoyable. Got up n just left."
2804,Nola Box Supply,29.963499,-90.118813,16.0,"Plenty helpful these folks are with a host of cardboard products to serve all your paper substrate needs.  Front of the house admin types are friendly and prompt, and back of the house go-for types equally so.  Beats compromising what you really want in lieu of going to big box hardware or office supply."
2781,Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen,29.989371000000002,-90.0723566025,18.0,"I knew better before I went to this location but hunger outweighs my better judgement more often than not, and they were the only location open. Or so I thought. First, they need to update the hours of operation online bc it says closes at 1am, yet I'm sitting in the line at midnight like a fool bc surprise surprise, they're closed. This isn't what drives me about MOST fast food/customer service jobs, and I use the term ""customer service"" lightly. What bothers me is that out of the THREE people who were still inside of the store, NOT ONE decided it would be an awesome idea to let me know that they were in fact closed. Needless to say that this right here is a perfect example of why most lazy a** workers are being replaced by automated systems. HOORAY!!!! I can't wait until I can deal with robots. You see POPEYES, thank goodness your food holds a certain status bc the service leaves much to be desired. Y'all should def take a page out of the CHICK FILA handbook....."
290,Steamboat Natchez,29.9552227147,-90.0627100468,18.0,Wow. We visited NOLA last week and took the truly awesome and informative  Steamboat Natchez trip on March 30. Can't tell you how interesting it was and pleasant. Plus these people are so well-organized and nice. JoJo reserved us a window seat - just could not believe the kind and excellent service.  Very very nice.  Recommend!!!!
3435,Plum,29.920761,-90.11590799999999,19.0,"Plum is such a neat store. The owner is one of the friendliest shopkeepers on Magazine and is always ready to help. This is a great place to get a NOLA gift, or a present for any occasion. I have bought so many cool items here, including many gifts for myself. I love that they carry the ""Ain't Dere No More"" items like t-shirts and mugs featuring Morgus. I also love that I can find things by Heather Elizabeth, who is one of my favorite NOLA artists. My friend bought an amazing Mardi Gras heart charm there this year. This is a store that is definitely worth stopping in and checking out. I guarantee you find some neat item within its walls that would be a perfect gift for someone you know or yourself."
1735,Bourbon House,29.954618,-90.06918,11.0,"Came here for the oysters three ways, but they no longer offer the dish. This was one of the best dishes in the quarter.  I enjoyed the frozen milk punch.  The chargrilled oysters were above average, but the gumbo was terrible.  Lacked flavor and was barely warm.  I suspect they use gelatin to thicken it. Just awful!   A friend ordered the corn and crab soup and was very disappointed as well. After spending $140, I was very disappointed.  I used to suggest this place to friends and family visiting, but I don't think I'll be doing that going forward.   This place used to be incredible, but has severely gone downhill. Terrible representation of creole food. I hate to leave this review Bc I worked at a Brennan's restaurant well over a decade ago.   Bring back those oysters three ways and get back to the drawing board with your current gumbo recipe!"
3160,Acropolis on Freret,29.935009,-90.1046165451,17.0,"Wonderful service with great food. We have eaten at the Metairie location but this is our first experience on Freret, definitely won't be our last! CJ you've got a winner!"
2819,Dynamo,29.968507199999998,-90.0591496,19.0,"I visited this shop with two friends - one being completely new to the whole idea.  Because the shop is not yet ready to open, we were able to set up a private appointment.  The front room was filled with plenty to look at and purchase.  All display models are powered via battery or plug and even one that recharges like phone through a usb cord.  Once the remodeling and the shop are complete, I can only imagine how amazing this place will be.  The private appointment was perfect for the first-timer in our group and she felt completely at ease asking questions (the other two of us felt the same way.)  I agree with the previous reviewer that this is a progressive, lady-friendly sex boutique.  They sell safe products - not the cheap toxic ones you find everywhere else in the city.  There is no pressure to buy anything, but we could not help ourselves and all three of us left with bags containing multiple items.  We met with Hope and I can tell you from experience you can ask her just about anything and she will answer without any judgment.  She really believes in educating and empowering women and is an asset to this city.  Their prices are very reasonable for the product you get and well worth it.  I believe they do pop-up shops while they are finishing the remodel and I highly encourage anyone - especially those who are new or too nervous, shy or embarrassed to visit the type of shop you typically find in New Orleans - to go check them out.  You owe it to yourself."
2663,Off Da Hook,29.9439946,-90.0523001,17.0,"Amazing. I'm from Seattle and this place was rad and felt authentic and local. Perfect walk from the ferry and a good escape from the tourist traps on the other side.  Portions are big, so be careful. Also very friendly owner / staff. Felt welcomed."
2887,Café Amelie,29.959867300000003,-90.0629027,17.0,Okay so I did not stay and eat. We came in and were taken upstairs to this stuffy ads room while there was plenty of seats on the lower level. So I left. FYI they print the menu daily cause we considered ordering but the lamb we wanted was not on offer that day. I gave it two stars cause the ambience is so nice and for the possibility of good food. Lol
3232,Bottom of the Cup Tearoom,29.954850800000003,-90.0663285,19.0,I had the most AMAZING reading with Patricia. The store is well stocked with great items and the staff there were very friendly. Highly recommended to go.
252,Frank Relle Photography,29.959774100000004,-90.0629785,19.0,"If you're a night owl like me, you might find yourself drawn to Frank Relle's special kind of photography. It seems to all be done during the late night/early morning hours, while the rest of the world is asleep.  There are some haunting pieces in his work, and one of my favorites is that of a cemetery and another is of a lone moss tree in the middle of a deserted bayou. When lit correctly, these photos take on another dimension and certainly tell a captivating story. There is something a bit mysterious about photos such as these, and they are right up my alley.  When I was here for Dirty Linen Night, I was greeted by the gallery manager, who was quite friendly despite the crowd. The photos are well priced and could easily be added to any collection and find a spot in any home."
2662,Uptown Frames,29.9302252,-90.1320316,17.0,"As an interior designer, I highly recommend this frame shop.  They have 5-star craftsmanship, endless frame options, creative staff and quick turnarounds.  They have got to be one of the most experienced shops in the city.  Oh, and they also have artwork available for purchase.  - great place to grab a thoughtful gift"
2772,La Fin Du Monde,29.925453000000005,-90.08442099999999,18.0,"We ate here during a one week vacation in New Orleans. Some of our foodie friends from Chicago had eaten here on a trip in New Orleans and recommended it to us. This was one of my favorite places we ate on our trip. We came on a Wednesday and it was very quiet. It has a relaxed ambiance, and the big tree in the court yard is beautiful. My husband loves cocktails, and was very pleased with the drinks he had. They have lots of small plates and we were ordered a bunch for the table and shared everything (my favorite way to eat). I am vegetarian, so I was pleased that they had lots of veggie options between appetizers, sides, and mains. I had the roasted vegetable polenta, which was amazing. Our server was very nice and attentive and gave us good tips on drinks and the menu. I would definitely recommend checking this place out!"
1824,The Original City Diner,29.953251730300003,-90.07225099950001,15.0,"Born and raised in NOLA (not Metairie, NEW ORLEANS) and having served/tended bar in the French Quarter for a number of years, it takes a LOT for me to write a bad review.  A group of around 8 people came here for breakfast and were given quite possibly the worst service any of us have ever experienced. There were maybe 6 other guests in entire the place.  I don't think there was a manager on duty, which may have been the root of the problem.  Either way, we were treated as if we were an imposition.    Our ice waters came one at a time.  Literally, one at a time.  Then when we ordered cocktails (from a completely different server), we were told they were out of the following (not told upfront, but AS we ordered the items, we were informed they were out) - Champagne All juices Ketel One Grey Goose  And finally, they were out of croissants.   After waiting 35 min for drinks, I finally went to the bar and stood there while the server poured the beers, then I served them to the table myself.   20 minutes later, the food was served cold and incorrect, but yes, the pancakes are big.    We were fully charged for our meal and not once did we receive an apology or explanation for the wait, service, or attitude."
1439,Nick's Bar,29.959892,-90.08720600000001,11.0,"Nick G Castrogiovani's Original Big Train Bar...  Say that it ain't so, Joe.  This is the place that the Golden Cadillac was invented... It was a great place to drop by in the mid-70s.  Lots of memories... This one has to be re-opened."
918,Fat Tuesday,29.9584761,-90.06593620000001,17.0,Love to grab one and walk around French quarter. 190 octane is tasty! Can't finish a large - get a decent buzz about halfway through when you add an extra shot.
2873,Green Room Kukhnya,29.969301799999997,-90.06373690000001,3.0,"Just good, tasty Slavic food, made well. Was the kitchen popup at Siberia, now on it's own and better than before."
1718,Greg's Antiques,29.9610044,-90.05928370000001,18.0,"This place is fantastic.  It's the antiques store I've always dreamed of, but have never been able to find.  Charming, well-constructed antique furniture at prices that won't break the bank.  Most of these pieces would fetch 5 or 10 times as much money if they were being sold at an antiques store in the greater NY area.  I want to rent a van, drive down, and furnish my whole apartment from here."
3092,Arcadian Books & Art Prints,29.958533000000003,-90.06479590000001,19.0,"I can't confidently give a 5 star rating because I didn't really experience it in its entirety but I feel like I have to because I walked out with a grin ear to ear.  My friend and I stopped in because it held nostalgic memories for him and we perused for about 10 minutes before we headed out without buying anything. Sorry. But seriously, it is a beautiful little room with floor to ceiling books and you cannot help but smile and start whispering stories about your memories with books and similar bookstores.  There really is absolutely no telling what books there are in there. If I ever head back to New Orleans I will definitely stop by and just spend some time there escaping from the business of the tourist trap that is the French Quarter."
3540,Hazelnut,29.9212765,-90.11644190000001,19.0,"Posting a whole slew of reviews for stores I hit with my Mom on Black Friday. Hazelnut is owned by local Broadway/TV celeb, Brian Batt and it's biggest claim to fame is the New Orleans themed toile.  The store carries a variety of upscale & trendy home decor items.  It's a small store with a lot of stock (especially during the Christmas shopping season) so be careful.  Yes, another store where I'm afraid of knocking everything over."
1490,Family Dollar,29.9457461,-90.09022829999999,20.0,"Wow. What can be said. What you see is what you get.   Parking, ha, why do it. Why not just hang around the parking lot like everyone else????  And inside the store, foooooorget it!  Idk what was going on, renovation? Store closure? Smh. Boxes upon boxes, empty shelves, half filled shelves... literally a mess.   No next time for me, I'll pass. Lol."
2306,Fat Boy Pantry,29.938054100000002,-90.0711912,18.0,Lobster poboy is all I will say !!! Best hands down !!! So delicious and the ice cream is great as well
3332,Chris' Cakes and Donuts,30.047695500000003,-89.96322679999999,15.0,Donuts are okay at a reasonable price.  But not a lot of other option right nearby.
3482,Cibugnù,29.947212100000005,-90.0715342,1.0,"Living in the neighborhood, I had suspicious about this place as their neighbors on each side are always packed, and Cibugnu is often empty.   Let me start by saying the food was OK - not the best, but certainly decent.   My reason for a 2 start review was due to service. To start, when I went to order wine by the glass, they were out of my first two selections (they maybe sell 4 wines by the glass). The waitress told me that I should opt for an alternative, that was approximately $6 more by the glass. I should have asked, but I assumed she would have charged me the lower price considering they were out of the wine I requested. It was kind of tacky - not the diners fault your lower price point items are out of stock, if anything she should have been upfront about this when we told her we'd be drinking wine by the glass that evening.   secondly, I was on the phone describing to my sister where the restaurant was so she could meet us, and the waitress overheard me (mis)pronouncing the restaurant name - and she walked over to me, and correctly pronounced the name in my ear (while i was on the phone!). I think she was trying to be helpful, but it was extremely rude and awkward. Who wants their waitress whispering in their ear while they are on the phone? It also came across as condescending. She should have stopped by later and informed me on the correct pronunciation.  overall, the experience just gave me a bad vibe, especially when there is another Italian spot right next door. pass."
2435,Dirty Coast,29.958372999999998,-90.064627,18.0,"They lose one star because the order was wrong,  I have alot of NOLA t-shirts,  when dirty coast had a sale I jumped on it, they had 2 that I really liked, ordered those 2 plus one for my wife, they got here quickly and was excited, when I went to put it on they sent the wrong size, I  contacted the company and they offered to switch them but by the time I would send them back to get new ones it was to much of a hassle to do, my wife now has 2 new shirts and I'll wait till I get back to buy from the stores. That's the fun of internet shopping."
3223,Ricca's Architectural Sales,29.979345399999996,-90.099723,17.0,"Unique, wonderful store! I have gotten a stained glass window there and most recently the carpenter was able to rebuild a custom casement window for me. The window rebuild was very quick and price was right on par or less than contractors I had gotten quotes from. They have a great selection of doors, windows, hardware, and tons of fun one-of-a-kind pieces. Very friendly customer service also. Great New Orleans business."
896,Fat Catz,29.9568494,-90.06706750000001,5.0,"Went in on a Wednesday night and they had an awesome MC! The place had a huge diverse crowd, young/old, black/white and everyone was just plain enjoying themselves! It is a little dirty, but not too many bars on Bourbon are clean!! Best 'dance' bar we went to hands down, we'll definitely be back on our next trip to Nola!"
3021,Bywater Brew Pub,29.963690399999997,-90.046948,19.0,"Stop what you're doing. Put on shoes. And no matter your mode of transportation (walk, drive, bike, Falkor, etc) head to Bywater American Bistro and order yourself some of the most creative and mouthwatering food New Orleans has to offer! The dishes offered at this neighborhood brew pub are heralded as Viet-Cajun, and we loved all of it!  We started our meal off with the cheesy egg rolls, and knew we were in for quite a treat. The outside was a perfectly crisped egg roll wrapper that crunched with each bite. Inside had mounds of oozing, gooey cheese. They were like mozzarella sticks with even more flavor than normal. For our meal we shared the  Phorrito, which had Sliced Roast Beef, rice noodles, onions, scallions, thai basil, bean sprouts, cilantro, sriracha, hoisin wrapped in a hot flour tortilla with a side of pho broth gravy for dips, and the Vietnamese Crawfish Etouffee Nachos. The Vietnamese Crawfish Etouffee Nachos has so many words in the title and even more flavors to enjoy! Fried wonton chips, chedder & cojita cheese, scallions, cilantro made for the perfect pairing for each of the beers we tried.  As for the beer selection, it was very impressive. We tried a few as it was happy hour pricing (bonus!) While they had many selections you'd expect, we really liked their Vienna lager spiked with New Orleans Chicory coffee because it felt like something you could only get in the Big Easy. It was almost as bold as the Deb Does Chocolate - Chocolate Stout which featured mammoth amounts of flavor.   We loved our experience so much that each night during our visit we contemplated eating at Bywater Brew Pub a second (or even third) time! The customer service was stellar too. Our waiter was so chill and friendly that I wanted to be their friend. This added to the overall dope vibe of their venue, which was very welcoming and gave off the feel of a neighborhood chill zone!"
2401,Dollar General,29.965287100000005,-90.03097609999999,17.0,"I came on the recommendation of Hannah and Kaylee. Don't know who they are? Let me reference the particular video in question. https://youtu.be/BrMljHFFTRk Freaking hilarious! And these gals are from the country in Louisiana.  Now on to the serious note of the review.  I was in and out in under 10 minutes, having perused the store looking for that one needed item I desired. The clerks are friendly and patient. If I am in the area and need something, I will be back. This area is kind of a food desert. While the Dollar General does not sell fresh food, the fact that they are here in an area that is gentrifying in a scary way, it leaves the lower income residents still in need of a food source. This has been a major problem in this area for a long time, probably forever in that this is a food desert. For those who don't know what a food desert is, I will attach a couple of links at the bottom of this review.   http://americannutritionassociation.org/newsletter/usda-defines-food-deserts  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_desert  https://secure.feedingamerica.org/site/Donation2?df_id=25031&mfc_pref=T&25031.donation=form1&s_src=Y17YP1F1X&s_subsrc=c&s_keyword=food%20deserts&gclid=CjwKCAjwhYLLBRBIEiwAtFeED0368LbIeHlvOddxqlNEXZyJIhYo5vz2BAqtWU8thZf_sUDa9DvpdRoCRBAQAvD_BwE"

Holly was very easy to work with and has immense knowledge in her fields of practice.  THe information that I have received, has been spot on.  I cannot express enough, how un-intimidating the experience was.  I felt very welcomed, honored, in-tune, and guided.    Thank you Holly!  I truly believe that everyone needs a session (or two) with this compassionate soul."

746,Kyoto,29.924391600000003,-90.1084046,2.0,"The service is kinder, the poke salad is gone, and more rolls to soothe the American palate than ever. Does every menu in town have to pander to a damn football team?  Props to the female sushi chef behind the counter. Even in the 21st century, that's a rarity."
2981,MS Rau,29.957590999999997,-90.064918,18.0,"If you really love antiques, especially those from 18th and 19th century Europe, walking in here is a bit of a religious experience. You will be amazed as you walk by row after row of items that are as beautiful as the day they were created. If you are a fan of vintage Tiffany silver and glass, this is definitely your place. Also, if you are in need of suitable furnishings for your new chateau, ditto. You will definitely wonder why the Katrina looters opted for electronics stores rather than places like this, but perhaps it is a matter of taste. Unless you are old or can flash an AMEX Centurion card, expect to be ignored - but can you blame them? How many people have $80,000 just waiting to be spent on an armoire (albeit a very beautiful, 18th century gilded one)?"
1912,Jazz Café,29.9529679169,-90.06624553350001,17.0,Stopped for a Bloody Mary cuz I heard the great live jazz. $12 is way too high but it's a cool place.
2962,Singleton's Mini Mart,29.9351614,-90.13247940000001,18.0,They were so nice! A little thrown off from their veitnamese and po-boy menu...but it was good!
364,Shake Shack,29.951292600000002,-90.065744,17.0,The burgers are very juicy and have a good flavor. I really like the lemonade. The fries are way too expensive for the size of the portion. Overall it is a good burger but for the money there is better out there. The service is fast and I like the tablets that you place your order on. Where they lost me is with the oversized paper bag and cbig cardboard tray and the single use plastic cup and straw that will end up in a landfill and sit there for hundreds of years.
3519,The Lucky Ladle,29.931299,-90.073893,16.0,"Alright, I guess. Friends wanted to try somewhere new so I made the trek arriving at about 11. We were one of only three tables. Service was efficient but aloof. I ordered the 2 dat breakfast: two eggs over easy and two sides, home fries and sausage. I had to steal toast from my friends breakfast because it was a little too runny. Tasty sausage, abnormally tiny cubes of flash fried potatoes. I liked the mismatched blue chairs and exposed brick walls, as well as the cheap prices ($7 including coffee) but potatoes are a dealbreaker. Probably not going to come back."

The tonkatsu ramen broth extremely flavorful, the pork warm and tender, and ramen cooked to perfection. Looking forward to trying the rest of the menu."
2631,Piazza d-Italia,29.948828999999996,-90.06676999999999,17.0,"This is a striking plaza, worth a look if you are in the area.  A must-see if you are interested at all in architecture.  Regretfully, this place seems to be on another downhill slide.  There was a major renovation in 2004, but some sprucing up is needed again.  Several heavy tiles have been taken up and are randomly lying about.  Drainage seems to be a problem, as there is alot of standing water.  The facade could use washing, as it is discolored in places.  No one at all was visiting the couple of times I checked it out while staying at the Loew's."
3077,Saint Claude Social Club,29.931428855100002,-90.07466934620001,17.0,"Let me just say that every time I walk into Saint Claude Social Club, I feel so hip and trendy and cool. Like Sara Jessica Parker entered my body and I'm now a cooler more fashionable SHERO. That's seriously how you feel when you walk in. The decor of the store honestly makes you want to sit around and talk about the importance of social justice with well-dressed women. There was a time I actually sat in their cool chairs drinking champagne talking to ladies. It's so pretty in there, dawned with beautiful artwork of my favorites are portraits of women. Clothing and accessories all strategically place and almost look like artwork.  The ACCESSORIES.... So many greatly crafted pieces in the store. Especially their bracelet collection. If you are looking for staple accessory pieces this is definitely the location for you. One of my favorite things is actually a pendant which is a naked lady frolicking. Lots of eclectic pieces you will find as well.  There are also some great unique clothing options. Dresses and skirts are very cool and sassy.  Definitely go in and check out this store when you get a chance."
374,Hong Kong Kitchen,29.965627899999998,-90.2056741,17.0,"This place does not serve chow fun, even though their menu online lists it! Very few places make chow fun anymore so I was disappointed. I settled for Mai fun instead but it was bland. I would have drowned it in sriracha or soy sauce if I had any. I think this place could be really good, but I did not order the right thing. Serving size was good for the money."
672,Arhaus,29.948373920399998,-90.074621737,18.0,Bought 10 k in furniture. All in stock. Still waiting 6 weeks later to have it delivered. Even tough it was shipped to another state 1st time and now back to Ohio a second time. Third party delivery system is a nightmare. You have to wait 8 hours to have logistics find your stuff. No one has any idea where anything is. The third party deliverer needs to be terminated. It's a joke.
1802,Taqueria La Coyota,29.9650221051,-90.0093770748,18.0,"This is my favorite truck in the whole city. Jesse, Hayden, and Guille serve the best pupusas I have had in my entire life and they serve it with pickled cabbage, beets and onions. All the meats are cooked tender tender tender, but it's the lengua that really captured my heart.   All the locals know about it, but if you're anywhere downriver of the CBD, it's definitely worth the bike ride."
1693,Brewstock Homebrew Supplies,29.953028000000003,-90.097181,18.0,"Brewstock is staffed with very knowledgeable employees who are passionate about what they do. Though a tiny space, this store is crammed full of a wide variety of brewing needs. be sure to ask if you don't see what you need- they don't even have enough room for all their stock, and the exact item you want may be tucked away somewhere just waiting.   I will say this store definitely caters more to the seasoned homebrewer than those just starting out, but it is undoubtedly a valuable resource in the area for those looking to brew their own."
171,Willie's Chicken Shack,29.953550699999997,-90.0690745,16.0,"Long wait but definitely worth it. Biscuits are on point!  If you're looking for good chicken, biscuits and honey look no further!  Bonus, they are everywhere."

Hint: don't ever write a note that says ""back in 5 minutes"" without writing the time you wrote that. Otherwise, I'm going to assume you mean 30 minutes, like almost everyone else. People need to know WHEN you wrote that so they know when to give up and leave. Can you comprehend how this would be infuriating?"

I am really happy that I got to see my friend's group, Steamcog Orchestra, perform here during JazzFest!  It's not far from the French Quarter and looks great day and night.

3235,Peychaud’s,29.957650899999997,-90.06602629999999,1.5,Fantastic new cocktail bar in the Quarter. Beautiful space inside. One of the best outdoor courtyards in the FQ. Cocktails are terrific with a mix of traditional offerings like Milk Punch or Ramos Gin Fizz and proprietary mixtures. Highly recommended.
1787,Kim Anh's Noodle House,29.937732,-90.195436,17.0,"This place is good for dine in or take out.  The service is always eager to serve.   The take out is quick.  I have liked everything I have ordered.  I love that it is 10 minutes from my house but I would drive further for it.  I would say it is a toss up between them and Pho Tau Bay for best vietnamese in town.  If I am not on the West Bank, this is my go to when I need some vietnamese."

The quality of their work is unparalleled and the craftsmanship on their corsets is simply incredible.   I have been blessed enough to wear several of their garments; the first time Marianne cinched me in, I was not sure how I would ever find my regular clothes attractive again. Each time I wear one of their designs, I feel like a walking piece of art.  You guys are the best, love your work! Visit their store, you will not be disappointed."

We walked around for about 15 minutes looking for a cute dress or something, ANYTHING that my friend could bring home to her kid.  When we thought we found the pot of gold, it was a $78 backpack.....for a 2 year old kid.  I'm not following this rainbow."

Really friendly staff- and the cook was pretty cute ;)  They've got a great selection of cheeses and the staff seems very knowledgable. I'll definitely be back!
2128,The Occasional Wife,29.9625744,-90.11663670000002,19.0,I have a long history with The Occasional Wife - mostly because I have some amazing friends. They moved me from the French Quarter to the Warehouse district years ago for the best move of my life. They have helped me get to the bottom of things in the chaos of my closet. Have I had a glitch or two -sure but Kay has always made sure that in the end all is right. I can't imagine trusting someone or their team more. I only wish I could have them help me more often!
2223,Francesca's Collection,29.923329499999998,-90.0886163,20.0,I spent $250 here last week and a pair of pants I bought happened to be on sale. Realized they were the wrong size and when I went in to exchange for the same exact pants in a different size they said I had to pay the difference as the sale was over. I call bull shit on that and I will remember that and not shop here again. Sucks for them because I tend to spend a lot of money in there. Customer service tends to get lost in chains like these. Bummer.
1691,La Thai Uptown,29.924514000000002,-90.10878100000001,3.0,"Some of the best food I've ever had. Great service. We all had different items off the menu and everything was delicious.   The crab cakes, redfish, sea bass did not disappoint.   I would come back here again. Prices fit the quality of the food."
1645,B Sweet Bistro,29.960422614499997,-90.0681857765,21.0,"Business always looks closed due to the black curtains, but if that gate is open ya need to walk inside. So far I've tried several different cakes and each one has been perfection!"
1152,Tru Burger,29.947786600000004,-90.130095,18.0,"For the gluten intolerant/celiac crowd, the first thing you should know is that Truburger has a gluten free bun that tastes amazing! It looks a little weird, but honestly, isn't it the taste that matters (especially to those of us who usually can't even have a bun at a restaurant)!    The burgers and fries are great. My husband - who can eat gluten - says their regular menu items aren't anything to sneeze at either.  The fries also really good!  They have practically anything you could imagine wanting as a topping, and have a vegetarian option. So, it's a pretty customer-friendly place. Our service has also been great the few times we've gone. The atmosphere is also really nice - casual and fun.   If you're a Tulane/Loyola student or an Ochsner employee, they also have discounts for you.   I'd definitely check it out!"
2011,Fiery Crab,29.9538877,-90.07241379999999,14.0,"The food and the service was great, I'll definitely returning! No wait at all, bathrooms were clean as well which is something i always look for."

Flour tortilla inside a crispy corn tortilla !  But next day there were 2 flour tortillas for each taco . I hope they keep the crispy corn tortillas ! But no matter what .  They are so good !  Can't wait to try the other sandwiches !
2639,Old Marquer Theatre,29.968625,-90.051992,2.0,"A great little theater in the marigny party of New Orleans.  Houses high quality shows with lots of variety, excellent ownership, and a nice place to experience a show."
3054,Camera Shoppe,29.955808899999997,-90.063873,18.0,I agree with all the reviewers thus far. Do not shop here unless absolutely necessary. The dude behind the counter really knows how to make you feel dumb and belittle you. Also doesn't hesitate to talk sh!t about other customers in front of you. Came in to get my cracked iPhone screen fixed. Originally just wanted a screen protector to hold me over in the meantime until the new iPhone came out. But the guy convinced me I was making the wrong decision and I should pay $100 to get the screen fixed. That's what I get for listening to the advice of a presumably trustworthy professional. Assured me that I would make my investment back by selling my iPhone 3Gs online. Dude did a crappy job! My phone now rattles and makes a horrible noise when it rings and vibrates. Also the screen is now starting to come off. WTF!!! Don't go here!
6,Style Lab For Men,29.9231001,-90.08834920000001,19.5,"Mark, the owner is almost always on site and is extremely helpful without falling in to  the pushy category. I'm a man that has a difficult time putting things together to make an outfit and Mark will pull a number of pants, jeans, shirts, belts, shoes, ties, sweaters, hats and even a cool scarf and tell you what works together to really ""make an outfit"". Prices are reasonable in that he often has a promotion going and I'm happy to pay for great service. 5 stars."
2002,Mahony's Po-Boys & Seafood  - Uptown,29.9225326544,-90.0901436806,18.0,"I ordered the ""peacemaker"" po-boy, which did not disappoint!!! I would've given this place a 5 but they didn't bring my appetizer, and the mustard I ordered was stale and in a package. Will I go back? Absolutely!!! Very cute and quaint, away from the hustle of bourbon street and the fowl smell. This is in the garden district. So enjoy a sandwich and then a stroll."
2703,Bourbon Rocks,29.9086493,-89.96993459999999,23.0,"Aahhh, Bourbon Rocks!  How they draw you in and you keep coming back!  During our first night here we were drawn in by the sound of Journey drifting out into the street.  The DJ's there were somewhat entertaining but I would say that it is the late night antics of fellow patrons that are the most entertaining. Does a booty shaking contest to Baby Got Back interest you?  That is the type of entertainment at Bourbon Rocks and the girls will find out that the hype dancers are pros!  They do have bathroom attendants which are best to be avoided.  Well worth a quick jaunt!"
270,LeMieux Galleries,29.944808000000002,-90.0671418,18.0,"In 2011 we bought a huge painting done on fencing salvaged from Katrina. We had it shipped to our home in Florida. A few years later, the paint started to peel off. when I first contacted the owner, she was amenable to having the artist repair it. We had a plan worked out, whereby the owner requested that she and the artist stay in our home while the artist repaired the painting. I reluctantly agreed to that. This would mean a trip from my main residence to Florida, but I was willing to accommodate in order to get the painting repaired. By this time the paint had started to disappear, either flaking off or completely absorbing into the fencing. There was a short-lived alternative plan whereby the owner would pick up the painting on her way through Sarasota to or from Miami, take it back to New Orleans, and then ship it back to us. After a very long time of negotiations, she notified me that I would have to ship the painting (I have no idea how would I would go about that) to her and she would have the artist repair it, but I would have to pay for the artist to reapply the paint, which by now is disappearing. So if you do not want to buy a painting with disappearing paint that will cost you enormous amounts of frustration, inconvenience and money, stay away."
3552,Philly Dat Up,29.999523999999997,-90.06196259999999,18.0,"I ordered Philly Dat Up through UberEats and I noticed that it's a fairly new business so I was skeptical, but I was not disappointed.   I ordered a regular sized Philly BBQ which comes with lettuce, tomato, mayo, bbq sauce, steak, and bacon. The portion size of the overall sandwich is fair but if you would like a little extra of something, you'll for sure need to ask for it.   The cheese fries were solid; the cheese sauce had a hint a jalapeño flavor so the cheese wasn't too bland. The fries were slightly undercooked though.   They made my food in a short period of time and it was delivered fast. I had an overall good experience."

633,Latin's Hand,29.9589805,-90.0605526,19.0,We've brought about eight stylish and durable hats from Latin's Hand. On our second trip to NOLA we were happy to see our favorite hat shop. Their hats are well made and reasonably priced. Everyone of the sales persons are friendly and helpful. Why is the shop listed as closed? We were there in April 2018.

1250,Rib Room,29.9562854,-90.0657355,14.0,"Expensive but simple. Nothing much to brag about. Hotel fare, ok staff. $20 for breakfast buffet . Had omelet station which was good and chef super nice!! Had waffles and pancakes in hot trays- prefer fresh. Small selection of fruit - just blueberries pineapple and blackberries. Had cereal, small selection oh pastries, yogurt and maybe oatmeal. Had frozen type hash browns on line. Scrambled eggs in hot tray. Blueberry sausage which looked good but was ok. Spicy sausage and bacon also there. May have had biscuits on the line too.  Coffee was just that not great.  But every hotel needs decent breakfast and this one works ."
1610,Oriental Triangle Chinese,29.9560503,-90.1769075,3.0,"This was my first time here and it was a quiet Chinese restaurant. There were not many people eating for a Friday night.  We had a table of 5 and were seated right away and presented with menus.   We placed our drink order and perused the menu. I don't eat chimes very often so I felt a bit lost and the menu did not explain anything about what the dishes were or how prepared (fried verses sautéed)  The server was very polite and accommodating to our table and answered All of our questions about the dishes.   We all ordered combination dinners which came with the entree, soup, egg roll and fried rice. The prices were around 10 dollars so a sweet price for all the food.   Some things that were ordered were:  Shrimp with garlic  sauce. This had a great taste and was not fried and came with vegetables also.   Shrimp with lobster sauce.  The shrimp was sautéed and not fried with this dish. This can in a deep dish and was the consistency of a gumbo. It was good but I would not order again because I wasn't into the soupy gumbo type dish.   Mandarin chicken was fried and had some kind of sauce on the top. The sauce wasn't sweet not spicy. I only took a bite of this but could not tell you what kind of taste it had. Resembled chicken fried steak with gravy type sauce on top.   #tonsoffood"
2506,Pizza Domenica,29.965934700000002,-90.094647,21.0,"I was so excited to see this establishment have another location. I remember having the Clam Pizza at Domenica's and it was so tasty. I feel like the Clam Pizza here lacked a little flavor. I am not sure if the cheese is different or if it lacked a little salt. We also ordered  the Ham and Cheese Twist, which was good but super salty. The sauce that came with the app was really good.   Nevertheless, I still love the way Domenica's does their pizza. Hopefully some of the kinks are worked out. The staff and location is great!"
110,Raising Cane’s,30.0059929425,-90.03352497360001,18.0,"OK sooooooooooooooooo I'm not a chicken eater; as a result this review will be about the service on the 1st day of opening:  Signs provided a countdown to the opening, I found this to be a plus, no need to stalk the building, you know. AnyWHO, on opening day, in the drive thru, I found the cashiers to be efficient, friendly (speaking to my 11month old niece), timely &  swift in their transactions. I placed two separate food orders, one for my granny & my sister.   Pricing was fair, you can get a whole meal &  drink for less than $7; one of those 3 chicken fingers deals; that's cool, I've become so accustomed to $10+ for fast food meals until I was pleasantly surprised at this event.   The lemonade is very tasty &  since I only got a sip of my sister's, I vowed to return for my own.   As stated, the drive thru line moved rather swiftly considering this was the 1st day; I was impressed.   Only thing I would've liked to see was the store set a little more off the street because the drive thru line hung out into the street making passing as I exited a very difficult feat.   Glad it's here in the area; adds to the community in many ways."
526,Blue Frog Chocolates,29.921573,-90.1181947,19.0,"Someone brought a cellophane baggie of Blue Frog's Cajun Chocolate Bites to work.  After the first bite, I was hooked.  The chocolate bites are larger than an M&M and more rounded than a Smarties.  These bites are spicy on impact, but don't leave you watery-eyed. The spiciness helps bring out the amazing flavor of the dark chocolate. These aren't the type of chocolate that only burns as it goes down the throat, making you cough. These are smooth and delicious.  Palmface moment: I can't believe I was in NOLA over new year's and didn't know 1) Blue Frog was there, or that 2) it had been selected as best chocolate shop in NOLA for several years running."
683,Trinity Restaurant New Orleans,29.960238744699996,-90.0597599521,3.0,"The menu was so creative!  Everyone in our group enjoyed their food and drinks.  Highlights for me were the Crawfish Fontina Beignets and the Ricotta Gnudi.  My cocktail, the SRP Punk, was delicious.  Our waitress was so friendly and well-informed about every detail of the menu.  The owner stopped by to personally welcome us and asked for our input.  I thought prices were very reasonable.  I highly recommend Trinity!"

My issue comes in when then incompetent, over paid morons they have working here have time to cut up, play, and joke around, but they are too stupid to look at the order read it and make it. Stay away from this place as it is over priced and they are incapable of completing an order correctly."

3433,Life Boutique,29.920808500000003,-90.11574,17.0,"The owners are fantastic people, so I'm a little biased!  That said, Life always has a good selection of yoga/barre clothes, including Lululemon.  I haven't attended a yoga class here, but apparently it's very popular and inexpensive.  My best tip is to look here for Lululemon because they put things on sale after a few weeks and you can get a great deal.  I got some wunder unders I'd been seeing online for half off, simply because they were the last pair.  Online at lululemon, they were still full priced."
117,Squeal,29.949382300000003,-90.13266949999999,17.0,"Service here was excellent. They hosted us for an event and were awesome.   However, I felt that is where the awesome stopped. The food I had (brisket) was mediocre at best, maybe it had been sitting under lamps all day? The bread it was served on was tough. The mac and cheese was pretty good. My glassware for beer was dirty, chilled, and they were out of everything on draft."
4,Eat Mah Taco @ Pal's Lounge,29.976762,-90.086423,1.0,"Eat Mah Taco is a new pop up out of Pal's Lounge - which is a DIVE bar in Mid-City. By DIVE, I mean, DIVE. But, it's such an awesome neighborhood bar, it was actually voted best neighborhood bar in the local New Orleans paper.  Anywho, Eat Mah Taco is only on Tuesdays (let's hope they can come back on other days!) and each week there's a different menu. The first menu was fabulous - like gourmet tacos in a dive bar. You can choose between tacos or quesadilla and it's definitely worth your $$!!   By the time I arrived, around 8, it seemed as though meat was low, so I would suggest getting there early - but I definitely think it was because it was the first week. I actually ate the vegetarian taco which had black beans, tomatoes, cheese, and I had it as a quesadilla - and it was HUGE and only $4!! I highly recommend!! I am going back next week.  Not to mention - each week there is a different 2 for $2 special! Can't beat that - and it's totally worth it. Great stuff!"

I came in here to find some jewelry but, sadly, left empty handed.    I do wish that there was more merchandise in the store.  Coming from Chicago, I think that back home the merchant would have stuffed the store with at least twice as many baubles yet it would have the same feeling.  The store is filled with jewelry at all different price points.  And the chandeliers are for sale as well!"

It was 11 PM on Sunday and except for the mixed drink bars and Bourbon St madness, the cocktail bars we were looking for had closed despite the long weekend. We then stumbled upon this gem. Their drinks were simply perfect. Great ambiance, welcoming and detail oriented. Based on the number reviews, Jewel of the South seems relatively new. I hope it keeps all of its charm and quality. I recommend the Brandy Crusta and the Barbadian Gin Punch. Enjoy!"
3291,New Orleans Secrets Tours,29.956715600000003,-90.0635644,8.0,"I did the Ghosts of the French Quarter tour with my best friend who is very much interested in paranormal activities, so much so she has her own EFM reader. We tried booking a tour through Nawlins Theatrical but couldn't get a hold of anyone to make a reservation...let me tell you that this was a blessing in disguise!  I'm a HUGE scaredy cat and was very nervous about going just because I didn't want to be the victim of cheap tricks and jump scares. James Corbyn was our tour guide and he was INCREDIBLE! Genuinely a great storyteller and is very interested in the history of the city and stating the facts. The stories themselves were obviously terrifying to think about but it wasn't a scary tour by any means. My friend and I were with two other couples and I think that made for an even greater experience...we all got to share stories and get to know each other as we walked from location to location in the lower French Quarter. I cannot give a higher recommendation for this tour! Give this company your business and ask for James!"
1904,Swiss Confectionery,29.976990999999998,-90.092955,16.0,Ordered a birthday cake to be delivered to our hotel for my boyfriend as a surprise and everything worked out. He loved the cake - the flavor was very good (almond cake with white icing). The only small down side is that the cake was kind of crumbly but I am assume it is made this way so that the cake remains soft and fluffy.
1507,Hank's Meat Market,29.966584,-90.040723,16.0,"I was very happy on the first visit to Hank's Meat shop for their Trinidadian food, and meeting Mrs Queen Trini Lisa.  This is a family run operation,  inside of a mini mart.  Food is served to go from the counter on the left after entering.  Tried the Callaloo (pureed greens with coconut milk) with stewed OxTails, fried plantains and white rice.  Everything was authentic and very delicious.  Callaloo is a Sunday favorite of mine growing up, and their offering here was outstanding.  The oxtail was fall of the bone tender and paired so well with the Callaloo and rice.  The Callaloo here deserves another mention, it was so good, and a vegan option.  I will certainly have to return to try the curry goat and other items from the menu."
3429,Francesca's Collections,29.951534000000002,-90.065348,19.0,Have been shopping at Francesca's for several years now. Love the variety and the prices. All the girls in both Canal and Magazine St. locations are very helpful and friendly.
642,LolaNOLA,29.9562168,-90.06646459999999,18.0,"One of the challenges of Mardi Gras season is finding the right ball gown and then the jewelry to go with it. LolaNOLA sells quality jewelry that is not too expensive. For $80 I purchased a very heavy, well-made necklace with several jewels and a pair of nice sized matching earrings. They were wrapped up very pretty as well.  Staff will help you select the appropriate item and are patient while you try everything on. It was a slow day so we had a fun conversation as well about New Orleans and the current activities.  There is also a nice selection of accessories, prints and collectibles. Local artists are well represented."
3268,Rollin Fatties,29.955040000000004,-90.0768769,17.0,"OMG! So it's too bad they only allow 5 stars as a rating because these guys deserve 10! Found them at Gretna Fest this year. Let's just say Being vegan at any fest is challenging. So we're walking around contemplating how bad we are probably gonna have to eat, when my husband spots the food truck area. We go over and see Rollin fatties, (thank God) they were making more rice but assured us it would be done in a half hour or so. We walked around a bit and came back ordered the tofu fattie. It was amazing.! No joke, they are huge and delicious! Can't beat the price either! Follow them on Twitter so you know where they are everyday and EAT people! Bottom line, great people making great food! Love y'all"
2395,Brad & Dellwen Flags,29.9295893,-90.07697840000002,18.0,"A true flag extravaganza!  Also, the nicest people in the world.  I accidentally walked out without a flag I had bought and just called them.  They are putting it in the mail to me today and could not have been nicer."
1302,Dominique's on Magazine,29.9212,-90.099559,2.0,"The only reason why I chose three stars instead of four is because it didn't WOW me. I didn't leave thinking that I should come back again. I got their take on Spaghetti made with special meatballs. It wasn't your average spaghetti. The noodles kind of reminded me like ramen noodles. That was different. My entree with just subpar. It was good, but not super fantastic delicious.  However, what I did love about this place was the appetizers. You have to get the shrimp ceviche and the beef tartare. Yum Yum Yum. I went here for my best friend's birthday with all of the girls and we killed the appetizers. It was that delicious. They give you cotton candy as a complimentary dessert so that was cool. Now when you go to a classy restaurant such as Dominique's you're going to expect excellent service right? Well, you get two people to serve you. One is your main server who takes your order and so on. The other only refills your drinks. Sad to say I saw the girl who refilled our drinks more than our server. Server only came to take our order and other than that was rarely seen."
3478,Dickie Brennan's Steakhouse,29.954392389699997,-90.06874107040001,2.0,"This place is truly a class act steakhouse. When we first arrived for our reservation we were greeted by three friendly hostesses. The place was bustling and very busy. We were sat about 15 minutes later at a cozy booth. The service and food were phenomenal. The only reason why I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because my boyfriend's steak came out incredibly overdone (he ordered it medium- pink all the way through and it came out well, without a touch of pink). I understand that things happen, food gets messed up, but this is a steakhouse and a $40 steak. My boyfriend did not complain, I'm sure the steak would have been fixed and replaced, but we did not want to wait for another one to be prepared. My steak (the petite filet with blue cheese) was cooked impeccably at medium rare. Our sides- the au gratin potatoes and asparagus were amazing as well as our dessert (triple chocolate cake). All in all, the experience, service, and food was worth the money. Oh! And there was a trio of men walking around the restaurant singing to patrons- it really brought you back in time and they had great voices. This really added an extra touch!"
1700,Dino's Bar & Grill,29.93992,-90.06687590000001,5.0,"Uhhh... how have I never reviewed Dino's??  I have never been here where the service wasn't top notch. I sat at the bar tonight and we were treated like freakin' royalty! Do I want a lime in that cocktail? Why, yes I do and thanks for asking! It's dark and cozy here and they have Lagunitas, so I'm happy. Full disclosure: David and I were winding down our evening when we ended up here, so we weren't here very long, but so what? We came. We drank. We conquered."
1030,Fuel Coffee House,29.920684,-90.106394,13.0,"A while back, my impression of Fuel would have been much more along the lines of the older, low-starred ones.  It was an expensive (but not special) and not very welcoming cafe that actually kind of annoyed you with its brittle atmosphere and mediocrity.  I had stopped going altogether until I found myself hungover in that area one morning just  lurching towards a decent interior space with caffeine and edibles. It took me a while, in my state, to notice that they'd changed a LOT of things about the place.  It was one of those life-saving brunches where you don't really care that probably a good deal of your euphoria has more to do with the awful place you put yourself in before you got that orange chipotle sauced Huevos Rancheros and that perfect cappuccino. I've come back in better condition a number of times since then, and everything continues to be pretty lovely. The menu is very impressively diverse and gourmet for a cafe, and while it isn't a ""cheap"" place, it's quite cheap for the quality. In short, I don't know what happened to this place, but it's gotten really good!"
1024,Molly's At the Market,29.960150300000002,-90.05998879999999,7.0,"Cheap drinks, plenty of locals, a great respite if you're hanging in the quarter and don't want to end up on Bourbon or some shitty tourist trap. Oh, and the frozen irish coffee has been a lifesaver on more than one occasion!!!   Wish there were a few more bathrooms, but other than that, this is a great local dive that always feels like home."
913,Miss Claudia's Vintage Clothing & Costumes,29.920818199999996,-90.0992602,19.0,"Really great selection of funky vintage items and costume accessories. Shop clerk was friendly and helpful, and even went out of his way to cheer up my four-year-old daughter. I'd shop here every week if I could!"
2607,Batch,29.9551739677,-90.0699685266,4.0,"Batch is a cool, calm space just a few steps from bourbon street. We popped in on site (shockingly we did not consult Yelp first), poking around for somewhere relatively quiet to take a conference call with our west coast coworkers. This place was perfect, a small hideaway in the Hyatt on Iberville. Clean, trendy, with nice cocktails that were about the price you'd expect (~$13 ea).   Staff was very friendly, my bartender was very nice and made the drinks well but not with the casual familiarity of someone who does this day in day out.   The display of barrel aged potables behind the bar is very pretty and very tempting, but from a layout perspective it sucks for the staff. As an industrial engineer, I am maddened by poor process flow, and the poor bartender had to walk all over the place just to make a sazerac and a mule. I can't imagine how much worse that would have been if this place had been busy and there had been multiple bartenders...  This place would be four stars anywhere else, but New Orleans has a pretty high density of awesome places... so we're down to three. This is a good place if you're staying nearby, or want a chill cocktail to get away from the bustle and heat during the day."
1354,Freret Faire,29.935282436399998,-90.1062852153,14.0,Very disappointed in this new café. The service staff was very disorganized. The food was not fresh. The chefs were reading recipes on how to make salads and brought out the appetizer last after a long wait for the other food items.I hate to see this place when it's busy.
3555,Leo's Caboose,29.9269267,-90.0922954,17.0,"Been coming here since I was a teenager. Never had a bad experience. Food is delicious. Great, Friendly place. Nice familiar staff. Lunch and daily specials are great."
2674,Krewe Du Brew,29.937973200000002,-90.07593490000001,16.0,Owned by my daughter's law school friend.  We will be on New Orleans nect week to update this review.
738,LemonShark Poke,29.925444,-90.084109,18.0,"I love poke and was really excited to try this place since I don't live far and a little variety/competition to the nearby Poke Loa is a good thing.  Perhaps looking at instagram pictures set my expectation too high but it was disappointing.  Tried the Aloha Tuna pokeritto and while it was giant, it had hardly any tuna in it...it was filled mostly with rice and ginger.  Poke Chan's version is much better and has more fish.  Got a kids bowl for my kid and found out it doesn't include what they call umami toppings which my kiddo would have loved in his bowl...oh well, at least he had more fish than I did.  Small restaurant with bright interior and friendly employees.  For the taste and value though, I will go elsewhere & would not recommend...Poke Loa is just a few blocks away."
2535,Manuel's Hot Tamales,29.974083,-90.101704,20.0,"Oh my god. These were the worst tamales I've ever had. They were the size of chihuahua poo wrapped in corn husks. Only in the South have I seen tamales this small! This is crazy and their like... $1/ a piece!  Greasy,... so greasy that the bag you carry your tamales away in will be soaked. If you eat them... get the Rolaids out for later."
2835,NOLA Craft Culture,29.9750522,-90.10304670000001,19.0,Do you need all the fancy glitter for your carnival crafting? Then this place has you covered. They also have all the varieties of adhesives and feathers and what not.   One of the owners was working the counter and was giving a new rider great advice while I was there. I was seeking inspiration for a costume so not exactly what I needed but I'll definitely be back.  I also liked that they had some original artwork for sale. And their list of classes/party options look fun too!  The store is in a former 2nd story home so that means steps. Not sure that they have an accommodation for folks who can't do stairs.
2380,Red Gravy,29.920754,-90.0993213,8.0,"A truly delicious and authentic Italian experience. Im so happy Red Gravy has come to our neighborhood. My wife and I dined outside on their picturesque courtyard and enjoyed delicious hand made pasta, their signature meatball, and a plate of arancini. We were too stuffed to try dessert, but after looking at the dessert menu, we need to save room next time. I would share pics, but we had such a good time, we never even thought about our phones."
1591,Yuki Izakaya,29.963099300000003,-90.057714,3.0,This place was the perfect spot to eat while in New Orleans for work.  The service was fast and friendly and was able to accommodate to our larger group size.  The beef tongue was unreal and so tender which is not how a lot of places serve it.  We also had lots and lots of salmon belly which was superb.  The seaweed salad tasted super fresh and perfectly seasoned.  And lets not forget the delicious tuna.  I definitely recommend going here for some really good Japanese food.
590,NOLA Grind,29.93695,-90.102603,16.0,Good little breakfast/lunch spot by Baptist. Coffee was good. Good customer service. L
2213,Pizza Hut,29.9463721972,-90.1131697782,4.0,"Disappointed in the pizza. What can you expect from a Pizza Hut or dominoes? Not a lot, which is more than okay. However, when a pizza takes more than an hour and a half to come to my dorm, this is not okay. This being said, 10/10 would blaze and buy pizza here again.   Edit: my previous review was too nice. No marinara sauce for the bread sticks (which is a must these days) and the slices were uneven. Sorry I had to tip one cent. Also, five minutes late on the two hour delivery."
2263,That's Amore Pizzeria Chicago Wood & Fire,29.941358500000003,-90.0743596,18.5,"They opened during Mardi Gras - yep, crazy - but are a great new addition to the neighorhood.  Their ""deep dish"" pizza is true Chicago style, consistent with the location out in Metairie which is one of the few places outside of Chicago that I have ever had true Chicago style pizza.  On an initial visit to the new location of That's Amore on St. Charles they were able to make a custom pie for me before the crowds got too big and it was really good with a nice spicy tomato sauce on top and crumbled sausage so you get a little in every bite (though the crust was a bit too thick which led it to be undercooked and yeasty which my wife disliked).  On a subsequent visit I tried a slice of wood fired pepperoni pizza which was better than the most recent incarnation of Dolce Vita.  It doesn't sound like they'll be doing true ""Neopolitan"" pizza but they've got a great wood fired oven that they inherited from the old Dolce Vita business at this location and they're doing a nice thin crust option - not New York Style like their location in Metairie and not Neopolitan style but just a great thin crust wood fired pizza.  If you can do a good job during a Mardi Gras opening, I'm confident this place will be rock solid once they get some sleep.  :)   The owner is high energy and personable and it's unquestionably one of the few places outside of Chicago that you'll be able to get a true Chicago style pie.  Already about as good as it gets."
3536,Bright Eyes Optique,29.9472385,-90.11347070000001,19.0,"I was in desperate need for some new glasses when I decided to go onto Yelp instead of trusting those BOGO deals advertised on TV.   This place had the best reviews and is conveniently located so I went to check them out.   Scheduling was super easy, and there wasn't a wait when I got there for my appointment. Filled out a couple of forms then waited for less than a minute before the doctor came out.   In the small world that's New Orleans, turns out I actually knew her from working together a decade ago. As she was checking my eyes, we played catch up with everyone we knew. We both agreed that our former place of employment hasn't been the same since the storm. And neither of us have been back in ages. The exam- even with the catch up- was under 20 minutes. I told her I found my eye doctor!  Then my favorite part of my trip began. I examined almost every frame they had in stock. They had tons that were under $100 and even had another room in the back for the ones under $79.  I ended up grabbing one from the back since I knew I was going to spend an arm and a leg on my lens.   And I was right! Lenses were $300 because of my prescription and astigmatism. I decided to get the nicest ones they've got. No coke lenses for me!  It took me a couple of weeks to figure out my insurance coverage and which credit card to put everything on. They worked with me the entire time and were just generally very nice and patient.   Glasses were finally ordered, and I was quoted 5-7 business days. It ended up taking less than 3 days!  Will definitely be back!   (1 star was taken off because of the parking situation. Had to park around the block because I couldn't figure out if the attached driveway is only for staff or for customers too.)"
188,BOIL Seafood House,29.922959999999996,-90.0886304,16.0,Delicious sauces on boiled seafood. Combinations are unusual and don't sound good but are delicious. The Caribbean one was fabulous. It's a little expensive.
3321,Old Opera House Cocktail Lounge,29.957957500000003,-90.06639969999999,5.0,"It's a dirty bar on Bourbon street with a 2 for 1 happy hour and live music. It happened to be right next to our hotel so we would pop in for a drink or 4, not bad.   There was a singing bartender that was great, but her name escapes me now."
405,Down The Hatch,29.931768599999998,-90.0746949,6.0,I order from here almost every night while at work. I love that they are open late and deliver. I always get exactly what I ask for and how I expect it to be cooked. The only negative is that delivery can take a long time and they often run out of food. But I guess that can be expected with such a popular restaurant.
853,NOLA Distillery,29.9181381,-90.0926748,21.0,Was it worth the hike from the streetcar? Yes. Lots of choices to enjoy and friendly people. My head may hurt in the morning but it was all worth it. Hoping they show up in Ohio soon.
1411,Ticklers Dueling Piano Bar,29.9585064338,-90.06585594879999,4.0,A great piano bar with excellent musicians. Both the piano players and drummer were so talented. We had so much fun at Ticklers. You can request songs for $ too. My only complaint was they did not serve wine.
799,NOLA Smokehouse,29.927221000000003,-90.07436899999999,17.0,AMAZING!!! The BBQ at Nola Smokehouse is the best I've had since moving here. The bartender at NOLA Brewery recommended it after a lengthy discussion about the best places to eat. My husband had the tri tip with horseradish cream and I had the pulled pork sandwich with spicy sauce and a side of coleslaw. Everything was finger licking good. We will definitely be returning and bringing everyone we know along with us.
2760,Black Penny,29.960436879099998,-90.0682618348,5.0,I would like this place but all they're doing is playing one of our favorite bands for us and they don't even have any fucking Galliano!!!
2347,Mona's Cafe,29.970830699999997,-90.10091,18.0,"I really like this place. The only menu items that I don't like are things that I wouldn't like regardless of what restaurant served it. I always love the hummus, tabouleh, kabobs and shawarma. My absolute favorite menu items is the Lebanese Tea. Sometimes I buy a gallon of it to take home with me."
434,City Greens,29.9351825,-90.1085807,17.0,"Meh. Only one girl making the salads so the wait was annoying, but I love city greens so worth the wait right? Wrong. I ordered the chicken teriyaki bowl, get all the way to the end of the line, and the worker put the wrong sauce on the entree. Only for another worker to finally come out the back and tell her that they're out of teriyaki sauce to make the bowl as listed. So not only did she put the wrong sauce on, they didn't even have the teriyaki in the first place. THIS IS THE ITEM I CAME FOR. I settled for a hastily prepared Thai wrap as a salad. It was as meh as my experience. Advice? Have more than one worker on the line during dinner time (7pm) and know what ingredients you have available before wasting food making entrees that you can't complete. I'll stick to the Metairie and Elmwood locations."
1280,Tasty Treat Food Truck,29.9510658,-90.0715323,17.0,"Tasty Food Truck is a pretty good food truck turned restaurant.  Our food was hot, tasty and ready in a timely manner.  Great service.  While they were only 3-6 other tables we found ourselves being attended to by 3 different people to make sure we were ok and we never once felt neglected.      The only issue i had was that the prices were a little high, which seems to be a trend of restaurants that start as food trucks.  They're fairly new, so i'm sure they'll improve on the few areas they currently lack.   A welcome addition to the ponchartrain/gentilly area!"
1105,Royal Blend,29.957690500000002,-90.065304,18.0,"An Oasis from busy, loud, Royal Street.  You can make your own tea bag, you can jump on their wi-fi or you can just sit and relax in the quiet."
2420,Mo's Art Supply & Framing,29.966196999999998,-90.08360390000001,18.0,"Was a relatively short term resident of Nola uptown and when Simone and Mo's opened up I was overjoyed.  Well stocked, knowledgeable and reasonably priced and from where I lived, very close.  I'm an experienced painter and the team at Mo's was always ready to help and connect.  Thank you!"
3528,Shucks on Teche,29.946974100000006,-90.0525192,13.0,Just opened in the location of a fantastic fresh Seafood & baked goods location.  Great to have another small restaurant on Algiers Point!
2491,National Art & Hobby,29.921932799999997,-90.119676,19.0,"This is the best art supply house in new orleans, but it is definitely more expensive than some other places.  The staff is great though, and can always help you out if you have questions, even if they dont wanna.  Maybe i'm just partial to the neighborhood, i dunno.  whatever.  give national yer biz."
1304,The Elysian Bar,29.966882899999998,-90.0549542,5.5,"The old rectory building was turned into a bar and restaurant with french country decor. The cocktails, while fairly traditional, were on point and well made and not a terrible price at about $9/glass. The food was fabulous. We tried the crispy cauliflower, brussel sprouts, smoked fish, liver and toast, and the steak. I had trouble picking my favorite because they were all so good. The portions are small for the price but it is very delicious and worth the occasional splurge. If they ever decide to add a happy hour option, I would need to empty my bank account."
3543,Adorn and Conquer,29.930241,-90.07523,19.0,I love their new space inside the Rink. The light is amazing...thanks to the skylights. And the shop is open and airy. They've added a variety of items from different designers so now they have tshirts and cards in addition to jewelry.  I stopped in last week and bought gifts for 3 nieces with fall birthdays. They are still setting the store up so I'll have to check back soon to see what they've added. They are having a grand opening party for the new space on the evening of November 5th.
2155,Make Me Up,29.922493,-90.08954399999999,19.0,"Excellent line of products, as well as knowledgable staff.  Adorable & conveniently located in the Garden District.  I will always shop for makeup & get beauty advice here when in New Orleans!"
3264,Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen,30.0227511279,-90.061417222,17.5,"Quite possibly the most bizarre experience I have ever had in a drive-thru.  Let me start by saying the girl who waited on me couldn't have been either nicer or more polite.  I arrived at 10:30 and ordered 5 spicy chicken tenders.  I totally expected there to be a wait since they had just opened.  I pulled around, paid and then was asked to back up by the cashier at the window.  I have been asked to pull forward many times at other places when the food was going to take a while but this was a first for me. She wanted me to back up at least 15 feet.  As I sat in the car waiting to be summoned back to the window, I decided that I could not let this girl off the hook and planned to ask why this bizarre request was asked of me.  All I could think of was someone pulling up behind me and thinking that I was a complete idiot for stopping short of the window when there were no cars in front of me.  Believe me, I love using my horn and I would have honked at me.  After about 5 minutes, she reached out of the window and waved at me to pull forward.  When I asked her why I had to pull up, she told me that they would get a bad rating if I had to wait too long at the window for my food.  Really????????  I was so amused at her total lack of understanding of what she had just divulged to me, but I refused to call to complain for fear she may lose her job (FYI, for you Popeye's people, this was a few months ago).  Personally I think it is idiotic to place such pressure on people not even earning a living wage.  As everyone knows, fast food is not always fast.  I would much rather wait for hot, fresh food than be served something sitting under an orange light for one hour because these people cooked way too much chicken out of fear that the drive-thru timer police were coming to get them.  Popeye's, please change this method of measuring employee efficiency; it is really stupid."
98,Tanner Gallery & Studio,29.9594141,-90.0634514,20.0,"We stopped in this gallery while wandering around the streets in a Friday afternoon. I am glad we stopped in his art work is beautiful. The lady that was working the gallery was super helpful she showed us how all his paintings are layered, and when she turned down the lights in the painting it was like the whole thing changed...I loved it. I think we may stop back in a buying something these are very unique works of art."
2519,Louisiana Pizza Kitchen,29.961111,-90.05828309999998,18.0,The best pizza in NOLA!!  Nice place to go if you are in the NOLA area and you love pizza..
1872,La Divina Gelateria,29.957871,-90.064277,18.0,"This was our last stop in New Orleans before heading back home. If this review was just about gelato, I would give three stars. It was okay - a little icy but the flavors were good. My boyfriend loved his cappuccino gelato. However, I have never felt so uncomfortable at a restaurant. We weren't greeted or thanked when we left. The man working snapped and scolded an employee because of a mistake she made and that alone made me uncomfortable. I was afraid to ask for a sample because he was grumpy and I didn't want to annoy him. As a customer, I shouldn't feel this way when ordering and eating in your restaurant. We didn't stay to eat because I honestly wanted to leave as soon as possible. I was afraid to make one wrong move because I didn't want to upset the man working."
3459,The Holy Ground,29.9696163,-90.0939346,4.0,"A local pub even if you are not a local. Friendly bartenders, great art, great food -- oh and great beer. Open darts on Friday night.  Enuf said."
451,Poets Custom Framing,29.920196999999998,-90.1039507,18.0,"The owner is a true artist. I've had all my framing done here and the work is exquisite. I've had photographs, prints and canvases framed and they take a very creative and professional approach to each piece. The gallery also has great work by established and emerging artists."

3089,Hemline,29.923111499999997,-90.08794350000001,19.0,Love the selections in the boutique.  Lighting leaves a little to be desired.  It was a muggy day - the only part of the store that had AC was the dressing rooms.  So was dodging for light & trying to find AC.  Found a really great unique necklace.  Loved the selection so much visited the French Qtr store the next day to try & find something that they didn't have something in my size at this location.
1366,Riverluna,29.9312975227,-90.07413089280001,17.0,"Ah, the joy of discovering a brand new spot to linger that isn't yet completely packed at all hours!  I'm talking about the Lizzie Borden bathroom at Riverluna. Is it wrong that I just want to hang out all day in a bathroom festooned with Lizzie B graffiti? Riverluna's courtyard is a sight to behold, as they've commissioned a local artist to have at it. We're talking Victoriana meets The Bronx circa 1978. See my photo!  Ok, Ok, so I did tear myself away from the bathroom and spent some time in the really charming café, too. Thanks to the high ceilings and whirring ceiling fans, it's pretty open and airy. *Love* the atmosphere here.   Today I only had a masterfully prepared Americano, but glancing at their menu, I was stoked to see that they make oatmeal with coconut milk. For non dairy fans, they have at the very least flax, coconut, soy and maybe even almond milks (need to double check on that). I appreciate non soy options! I will be back soon to eat here (right now open for breakfast and lunch, but dinner will be an option, too) and will update.  Soon they will be adding a full bar, which means for late night chilin' with Lizzie."
2010,Salsas Por El Lago,30.021386,-90.115146,17.0,"Found this place on Yelp (thanks Yelp) while looking for somewhere close by to get some Mexican food. I had no idea this place was there but I'm glad I do now.   I walked in and there were only two other tables seated. I sat at the bar and watched the Hornet's game, had a few beers and ordered two pork tamales and a shredded beef taco. The taco wasn't spectacular, it was good, just kind of plain though. The tamales were great.   I told my server how great they were and she told me that they were two for one that night... my lucky day! So I ordered four more for lunch the next day.  I'm not sure why the place was so empty, other than the fact that it's hidden. If you're in the area, and are tired of the other Mexican places around there, this place is a must. Good food, prices are reasonable and great service - no complaints!"
2490,The Bean Gallery,29.979005883899998,-90.0963385852,16.0,"I love the bean gallery, I've been going here for about 2 years. It's the perfect place to study indoors or outdoors, great atmosphere, and delicious beverages! Parking is a little on the scanty side, however it's not hard to find a spot within good distance. Location is safe and provides easy access to this spot."
251,Popeyes,29.9212469,-90.0978321,17.0,I wasted 7 bucks on a meal I thought was going to be awesome. The fried chicken was stale and tasteless. They had no more wings only drums. At 4pm?! come on. The fries were old. I'm done SMH

2431,Parish Ink,29.921037100000003,-90.0958598,18.0,"This is a cute little shop that carries tshirts with a New Orleans and Louisiana theme in a city that seems to be full of shops that carry tshirts with a Louisiana theme.  Like Jen mentioned, they are from Laffy, so a lot of their shirts are Acadania-centric, but they have a good selection of NOLA themed shirts that are sure to satisfy anyone with local pride. Aside from shirts, they have baby onesies as well as themed coasters, magnets and post cards.  Their prices are fair and are shirts are only a few dollars more than certain shirts at other shops. Also, their shirts are unique- they don't ""recycle"" themes from other shirt shops and I appreciated that because it would be really easy to take a ""known"" phrase and put a new design to it."

2133,Big Easy Bucha,29.956762599999998,-90.0976778,14.0,"Really cool spot - you can sit and hang out and watch what's going on. You get to see the production in action, which is very similar to a beer brewery.   You can buy glasses of kombucha on site, or you can purchase to go as well. The 67 Oz growler is $10, which is actually a great deal.  The flavors are diverse and delicious. Including a ginger cayenne, satsuma, and pineapple currently, among others. It seems like they use a lot of local ingredients, as the satsumas came from an employee's family's farm. The kombucha is made very artfully and carefully starting with green and black tea. You can tell that they take pride in their work, as they should."

They messed up the whole order and forgot the wings. Then I called the Manger she barely listen offered no help at all. Just send me out my correct order and take this back. Nope never happened, she sent the driver back out  to get the wrong order still no wing and then refused to refund.. she never brought the right order, don't use your hard earned money here...they really need someone that cares about a job..I'll never order from this place again because if you complain she probably spits in your food..don't waste your time and money..go to the pizza hut on Judge Perez, they are the best..and to the manager, karma a bitch, just wait..and fuck you bitch..have a nice day"

It was a nice change to the regular ketchup flavor profile. Decor goes well with the menu.  Service was GREAT, quick, and attentive. Steve did his thing."
3208,Burger King,29.972644199999998,-90.04880779999999,16.0,"Burger King in general is usually always the most dirty restaurant you can eat at. Even in Wisconsin where everything is clean, Burger King is filthy. I would have to say though that this location is the nastiest, most disgusting establishment I have ever been in. I have traveled all over the world and I would rather touch a Tijuana street walker than any surface in this virus infested house of ""nobody cares"". If you order the mushroom and Swiss burger, don't count on getting any mushrooms on the burger because ""mushrooms be nasty, how you eat dat?""  There is no hope for this place."
469,HAUNT NOLA,29.959271500000003,-90.0625585,19.0,"HAUNT NOLA is exactly what New Orleans, and specifically the French Quarter has needed for a long time. For so long I wondered how the spooky/haunted capital of the country had gone decades without a place like this. HAUNT NOLA is the brainchild/gallery space of Butchovision. Butchovision in case you're unfamiliar, is known for crafting phenomenal horror themed art, patches, pins, and more.   You can find all of his custom creations and more at his shop/gallery which is attached to the Deurty Boys gallery space on Chartres. It's a small little space but it's packed with interesting finds and lots of character.   If you or a loved one is into all things horror/spooky, you have got to stop into this spot! I bought a few pins but want to definitely go back for some custom jackets and art. He has over 100 pins alone in the shop (how many do you think I can buy before my girlfriend sees my bank statement and takes my credit card away)?    HAUNT NOLA just opened up within the last couple months but it's quickly becoming a favorite amongst locals (like Alvin Kamara of the New Orleans Saints) and tourists alike!"
1556,Osaka Kohai,29.924836,-90.107078,18.0,"This is, simply, first grade sushi. Served perfectly by knowledgeable and friendly staff in the very comfortable surroundings of an old building that was a home at some point. The quality of the sushi and its preparation reminds me of sushi restaurants in L.A. The extremely reasonable prices do not. My only fear is that word of how awesome this place is will spread quickly and it will soon be too popular to be just a neighborhood spot where locals can drop by. Meanwhile, that's what it is. If you live in the neighborhood and you're looking for a Kyoto replacement, this is it and more."
389,IHOP,30.0465322911,-89.95886,15.0,"Okay, to start this review off, this is an IHOP, so don't expect anything spectacular; IHOP food is IHOP food whether you're in New Orleans, Beverly Hills, or Gluckstadt Mississippi.  Moving on.  So we decided to stop in here after a night on Bourbon Street, as we knew that at least at IHOP, we knew what we would be getting here.  We walked in and were seated in a prompt fashion.  The facility was clean which is a nice bonus for an IHOP.  We then were greeted by our server who was abundantly friendly and attentive; probably the best server I've had at an IHOP.  Throughout the entire dining process, she made us feel exceptionally welcome.  And for what it was, the food was quite enjoyable.    If you are looking for a friendly and cheap dining environment late at night in this New Orleans suburb, then this place won't disappoint."
3512,Mojo Lounge,29.9606059,-90.0592444,6.0,"So, this is my 2nd time dining at this place, so I guess that means something.  I had got their special fod a New York Strip steal topped with blue cheese crumbles and garlic mashed potatoes,  with grilled asparagus for $13.99 also came with a ceaser salad. Great deal, the meal was gorgeous, almost to fancy for decatur st. Lol. It was like enjoying a Royal St. $40 Steak dinner on Decatur for a way better deal. I would definitely try the menu offered here."
895,Lenora's Grill,30.026925,-90.03828299999999,17.0,Good food and marginal service. The view of the golf course is exceptional.
2560,MyEyeDr,29.920935200000002,-90.09719390000001,18.0,"Growing up with 20/20 vision sometimes makes you reluctant to go to the eye doctor as an adult and it makes it especially hard to know what prices to expect. With that being said, Uptown Eyecare has friendly, accommodating staff and doctors. Despite all of my questions and concerns, without hesitation, they ran my insurance twice to be sure the exam would be covered. When they fit me in last minute for a Saturday appointment, the doctor gave me a thorough explanation of each step and what to expect. I walked away with a prescription in hand as I explained their glasses prices were a little too much for a local teacher, and they completely understood."
1363,Huey's 24/7 Diner,29.956366,-90.062914,18.0,"The drinks were weak.  Especially the house daqauri, which usually I wouldn't whine about, but it seriously tasted like a smoothie.  That's what you get for getting drinks at a diner, I guess though!  They ran out of mint and brought a very weak and mint-less mojito, when we complained they did go to the store and buy some mint and made it up proper which was nice.  Loved the red beans and rice and french toast was really good as well.  No, I did not order these together, my fiance had the red beans and I couldn't help but steal a forkful here and there.  They were THAT good.  You could check in on Facebook for a free dessert or on Yelp for 10% off."
3297,Sprouts Organic Cafe,29.965342200000002,-90.0656443,18.0,"I might be biased to the location, since I can walk here. This business and the quality food they provide is worth driving the distance to. I love the Viva Colada smoothie and I prefer their elderberry syrup to conventional ones from the grocery store. I will be returning until I can try all the smoothies and juice. Remember eating vegan every now and then is good for you so support this healthy and happy business. Plus if you are hungover from raging on Bourbon, drag your vitamin deprived body here, the golden ginger juice and a sweet greens have always helped bring me back to life."
1529,Lowe's Home Improvement,29.984569,-90.05646899999999,18.0,"This Lowes does not even deserve one star. 28 days ago I bought a washer & gas dryer from this Lowes. They said it would be delivered in 3-5 days. What a lie. Ive called them at LEAST three times a day & have been told it's on the way. Clearly it has never been on the way. Meanwhile everyday I am arranging my entire life over these damn appliances being delivered. One week later I get a call saying my dryer was all dented & scratched, they asked if I even wanted it. I should have cancelled my order right then and there. I told them I wanted a new dryer because I paid for a new dryer. Two weeks later on my daily routine of waking up early to call Lowes they realized they ordered us a gas dryer & an electric dryer. WHAT?!?! Fast forward to this weekend...for the first time during this entire process Lowes calls me at 8 am and says my appliances are on the truck and they are on their way! At 3:30 pm Lowes finally arrives with our washer & an electric dryer. NOT the gas dryer we ordered. They said they would be back first thing Saturday morning. Well, It's been two days. I called this morning begging for a direct line to deliveries or a manager and they said that line was broken. The ONLY thing that went smoothly in this entire process that still isn't over is when they took my money!"
84,Tomasito's,29.945243800000004,-90.0674745,2.0,"Being a vegetarian while visiting New Orleans is no easy feat.  However, when I have found eats, they are usually very good.  Tomasito's was below the standard I have gotten used to.  Not to say it was bad, not at all.  I had the chips and a bean and cheese burrito. I would have gotten rice in my burrito but it was not vegetarian (really?).  Service was ok, and the flan was excellent (although ""with berries"" seems to mean one raspberry). That being said, at least there was food to eat on the menu, and that is not assumes in New Orleans."
3401,Peewees Crabcakes On The Go,29.945951,-90.087921,18.0,"*this review is based on my experience ordering through Postmates*  My jumbo lump crabcake arrived soggy, shaken up (probably because it was a bike delivery) and in a burnt container. It was a nice size, but it wasn't shaped like a crabcake and the consistency was on the mushy side. It was too salty to finish which is unfortunate because the price is on the higher side. Hopefully this is due to them using fresh crab, which would explain the pieces of crab shell I had to remove from my mouth several times. The 'Asya sweet and tangy sauce' tastes suspiciously like bottled sweet chili sauce. Tasty, but not signature."
2446,Attiki Bar and Grill,29.953394399999997,-90.0655896,4.0,They serve Grimbergen. The bathrooms are clean. The space is really airy. Friendly service.  We were only in during a slow afternoon and only for the ale.  Nursing mothers will love the overstuffed couch.  Hookas and martinis are available as well as Mediterranean food.
2882,Le Bayou,29.9572555,-90.06701770000001,5.0,"We went for late night dinner- had a group of 12 of us around 10pm. They were able to get us a table right away. Waiter was really nice and patient with us even though we had a big group and one of us spilled a beer . Had the taste of the bayou with jambalaya, gumbo and crawfish etouffee. Didn't actually know what etouffee was but it was my favorite of the 3! Reddish soup with a lot of flavor. Gumbo was my second favorite! Tasty and flavorful. The jambalaya was only ok, didn't have a ton of flavor or seasoning."
427,Full Blossom Chic,29.934956099999997,-90.106833,20.0,"I absolutely love love this place! Ever since it has open I have been a regular visitor finding these things from meetings, to costumes, to special events. I have managed to always find something great.   Daniela and staff is always helpful finding different things I may ask for as well as just putting things on side that she thinks I may like. I really can't go wrong with anything in this store.  Once I told her I would love a Monif C dress and she actually found me one!   This is a great consignment shop that you can bring some stuff into and actually want to use your credit with. Plus, the price is just right. Everything is seriously reasonably priced.  Also this location has great accessory finds. I have found countless statement necklaces as long with earrings to help me change my style up a little bit.  This is a great place to get a great personal shopping experience where someone is there to work with you on what works best for your body and your particular needs."

1870,Gracious Bakery & Cafe,29.9599391527,-90.10208627360001,16.0,"They get bumped up a star for their unique pastry case items.   This week I tried a couple of their savory pastries...a cruffin and a scone. I'm not sure what was really in either item. The cruffin definitely had cheese & garlic and the scone was mostly herbs. And they rotate what's in the case, so if definitely ask what's the flavor of the day to avoid stuff you're not fond of/allergic to.  I've been back several times since May and I've always been pleased with the quality, texture & taste of every pastry item.  Now if I could make it back over there for lunch..."

I love everything about this pizza Heaven. I'm a big gal, so just trust me on this, okay? I have a hangover and I'm going right now."
2364,Joan Good Antiques,29.959154700000003,-90.06389279999999,20.0,"This is a lovely place on Royal St. known for its antique shops. Antique shops always draw me right in and the ones on Royal Street were no exception.  I've always been a sucker for a time-honored piece piece of jewelry.  I was lucky enough to get my husband's great-grandmother's engagement ring as my own.  This ring is originally from the Edwardian era which has led me to search out other pieces from that time or made in that style.  It was an interesting time in history following as it did the Victorian era which many of us tend to know more about.  At Joan Good Antiques, you'll find quite an array of jewelry, not all of it antique and not all of it precious.  It's just a fun treasure hunt  to look around to see what you might find on any particular visit.   Sifting through things is always half the excitement for me in going to antique shops whether it's for jewelry or anything else.  I did find some pieces with gorgeous metal work, beautiful gem stones and some captivating amber pieces.  I've become interested in cameos the last few years and there were a couple of nice examples here.  Alas, I didn't buy anything on this trip and there was nothing Edwardian this time; I was sorely tempted by a couple of things however.  I'll be back for another look-see on my next trip. A walk down Royal Street while in New Orleans is a must in my opinion and this is one of many antique places worth your while.   The antiques you find in various cities across the country provide another way of learning something about history so I think they're worth seeking out."
1371,Chef Scott's Creole BBQ,29.9728963,-90.08060920000001,23.0,"Delicious amazing barbecue at French quarter prices for sure! I ordered the jerk chicken plate. $16 for a single leg quarter and two small sides. A little too much sauce, but a total rip off! Not good prices for such small portions. Really wish they'd been good and a decent value...especially in my neighborhood"
1180,Jazz Gumbo,29.95124802,-90.06675564790001,16.0,"This is your typical tourist souvenir store with anything and everything advertising New Orleans. It wasn't a bad shop, but it wasn't the best either. My niece got a NOLA T-shirt and a feather boa, my daughter got an alligator tooth (doubtful y'all) and a feather boa. The shop needed some serious work done on the ceiling and the floor."
44,Mojitos Rum Bar & Grill,29.961843800000004,-90.0576285,5.0,"Although only a short distance from the French Quarter, Frenchman Street is like stepping into a different realm. It's only two-blocks long but full of life and non-stop entertainment and on any given day of the week, you can hear the live sounds of reggae to Latin to blues.  To kick off a night on Frenchman Street, it's best to do so on a full stomach so stopped into Mojitos Rum Bar and Grill on the edge of Frenchman Street for dinner and a warm up to a night out on the town.  Just like a lot of the other places in the area, Mojitos has their own live entertainment and if u stay late enough on Saturdays a Latin music party. All of this takes place on their beautiful patio but you also do have the option of indoor dining but I highly recommend that you do not do that. Even consider sitting at their large outdoor bar before doing that.  Going to a place called Mojitos means you have to get a Mojito. Due to their namesake, they have plenty of options from specialty drinks to the typical fruit flavor kind. I started off with The Frenchman which was amazing and thank fully strong.  Later on, I decided to get another drink and selected the Ultimate Mojito. I know it said mint syrup and I don't know what I was thinking but it was the ultimate fail. It tasted just like syrup, medicine syrup. If you 'bout that sizzrup, this may be the drink for you.  We order the Jerk Chicken Skewer as a starter and it was so unbelievable delicious! Do you know how hard it is to go to a place that doesn't specialize in Jamaican food and for them to actually get it right? The flavors were on point and the spice level was beyond expectations. To offset the spicy factor, the blackberry brandy sauce added just the right touch.  There are only four choices for main dishes, but they all sounded so good, I still had a hard time deciding. I ended up ordering the Aruba Scallop. It came with grits and I am actually NOT a fan of grits but these were well flavored and a great compliment to the delicate and well cooked and prepared scallops. A dish like this has potential to lack flavor, but it was really good and had a nice kick to it.  My boyfriend ordered the Lechon Asado or as the menu states, citrus marinated roasted Kurobota pork belly. The meal was served with rice and beans. He thought it was really good taste wise, but was disappointed in the portion size which I guess was a little small but I was full after eating my meal.  I was very satisfied with the food, service, atmosphere and entertainment. It is a great place to hang out, to drink or eat food. It's a great place period. I will be back."

Made a purchase back in March and took advantage of the free shipping to my house so I didn't have to carry. Unfortunately, the shipment ended up being sent back to them twice due to no fault of their own, but they were very attentive and helpful, and my purchases finally made it to me in great quality.   Staff are also very knowledgeable on products and extremely friendly in the shop. Wish I had bought more!"

I think they've only been around for a bit and it's not super obvious where it's located - it's in the back of the Red Zone convenience store on Washington.  We had the chicken shawarma and falafel bowls, as well as some pita and hummus. All of it was great but the bowls were very good - lots of pickled vegetables and super fluffy falafel.  Will become a regular for us."
2480,Cocoally Vegan Boutique,29.930619399999998,-90.0756348,18.0,"One of these situations where I wish there were 10 stars to give.   It's a special delight that today I had the chance to support a compassionate lady / VEGAN / artist right here in NOLA, by bringing her adorable and stunning artwork into my life! ... It was a fun shopping experience, I bought several [vegan forward] animal prints, canvases, magnets and a tank top. I love everything so much but the little hanging fruit bat is my fave. This has been the highlight of my NOLA adventure. I felt so fancy coming back to the hotel with a bunch of local art and can hardly wait to see these beautiful pieces up in my home!    I know my family and friends will be impressed and I will send them straight to Ally's online gallery!  PS: cocoally.com (her website) has a vegan guide to NOLA. By way of that list, I found a place to order vegan pizza and am on my way to pick it up now"

While visiting Bourbon St. last summer my husband and stopped in one of the myriad hole in the wall places live music.  The difference with this place was we stuck around for a couple of hours because the music and entertainment were amazing.  Their set list is full of familiar songs, they get the crowd dancing and singing, and they are just plain fun.  Great stage presence, very welcoming of audience participation and engagement.  Can't wait to see them again!"
2005,Office Depot,29.976256,-90.0989177,19.0,"I'm going to avoid going to this branch around 11 am any day of the week. They made me feel like I was being a problem but in retrospect, they were probably feeling overwhelmed/overworked and cranky. They really had poor work performance.   I went in to get folders and a couple of copies of my resume. Two of four employees were very condescending about me requesting a particular type of resume paper, which should've been a non-issue. I liked the resume paper offered at the print station. The person working there sent me to the isle to buy a pack. But, the item was NOT there. (One guy told me ""it's just paper"", and indicated that I should just pick something. (He obviously hadn't looked in my buggy though. I had already selected a back up option BEFORE I made it to the print station.. .) Anyway, I'd feel like a clown presenting a resume on blue or almond colored resume paper. It's a matter of personal style, I guess. I just wanted the product that I like.) Another guy was intentionally nonchalant, and one was too busy to remember details long enough to be helpful.  It was a very uncomfortable trip (and took up a lot of time). I wound up buying prints that I didn't want because the store was OUT of a few types of paper. I wound up buying two prints of each document. The third copy had mix-matched paper. I did not purchase that."
2837,Marie Laveau's Voodoo Bar,29.955378999999997,-90.06433100000001,19.0,"I love this place, but in my most recent visit to NOLA, I couldn't find it!  I don't think that 501 Decatur is accurate, because that is the site of the French Market.  Someone with more knowledge than I, please update this place's address so I can re-visit it, or close this down if it is no longer there.  From what I remember 12 years ago, this was a tiny bar with strong, interesting cocktails and a gorgeous, Voodoo-themed interior.  It made me happy."
3370,CVS Pharmacy,29.9483739,-90.07462170000001,18.0,"Words cannot express how happy I am this CVS opened. It's frighteningly clean and the people who work there are SUPER nice. I've shopped and taken care of pharmacy needs at this location, and I've NEVER been disappointed. Well, the only time I was disappointed is when I was looking for red velvet oreos and they didn't have any.   I'd recommend this location to anyone. The lines are never long to check out and there are always enough people around to help you find what you're looking for."
1887,Gallier Restaurant & Oyster Bar,29.9533239,-90.07078979999999,17.0,"very fresh raw oysters , taste sweet. Fried oyster is nice. Cajun chicken is tender and juicy. Server isn't friendly as we thought."
1984,Cafe Dauphine,29.9590782,-90.02075119999999,18.0,"Fried seafood is good and Prices are decent, the Cheesecake is real good! I went there on a Groupon and ended up going a couple times after that."
2879,Chun Lee Chinese Restaurant,29.9614531,-90.18925990000001,17.0,"I can dig chun lee. Their Chinese food is pretty decent, the service is good. This place, to my surprise, has really good fresh sping rolls. So I went ahead and got their pho and it too was pretty delicious. I wouldn't get the general tso chicken unless you like syrupy sauce."
1566,myPhoneMD,29.932002100000002,-90.07361259999999,19.0,My precious is back in my hands thanks to these guys.  I did experience a few communications bobbles with them...some were probably my fault but not all.  My phone is fixed and for the price that I expected.  And the southshore location is certainly convenient for me....I just would have had my phone faster if I would have driven myself over to Mandeville.  For the record I have an Android slider phone; the cable between the keyboard and the screen finally broke when I dropped it one too many times.  Makes me think that I may have to look into a different phone this summer when my new every 2 deal comes up.
154,Broussard's,29.956643100000004,-90.0680566,2.0,"Broussard's was pretty good when I went there a few weeks ago. I had a Groupon that was about to expire so I took my parents out to dinner.  I knew going in that Broussards is a very old skool New Orleans restaurant, and it is very nice when you walk in to see the old tile on the walls in the foyer of the building. The courtyard is beautiful and I just had to turn into a tourist and take a picture in front of the fountain with my mom. We were seated and very promptly greeted by the drink guy.  He brought us our water and told us about the extensive wine list, but they were of course out of the Pinot Grigio that I ordered.  He successfully suggested a Chardonnay for me instead and I was happy. The head waiter came out and explained with great detail the specials for the night, but I went for menu regulars, the maytag blue cheese salad and the pecan crusted drum. I wanted more salad, it was so good, I ate it up so fast. The drum was excellent too. It had this soy butter sauce on it that was so good and topped with crawfish. I was definitely happy with my meal and glad I had the experience. What makes me knock off two stars is that though the foyer's vintage appeal is nice and the courtyard is beautiful, I feel like the dining room needs an upgrade.  The chandeliers on the walls in the main dining room are very reminiscent of the hallways of my grandmother's assisted living home. I think its just one of those places I am glad to say I've been to, but I don't think I will choose to go there again."
1550,Michael's Seafood,29.9630527,-90.1666857,18.0,"In the greater New Orleans area , this place will just about always have the cheapest prices along with some of the best quality , crawfish are always clean and fat and the service is fast. Seems family owned , I can always count on them offering lower prices than anywhere in buck town . Live crawfish almost no dead , maybe one or two . Good stuff here."
2315,The Palms Bar and Grill,29.94033,-90.1241112,4.0,The palms bar and grill is the move if you want to not remember how much fun you had or the delicious quesadilla you ate at 2am
2089,Red Zone,29.935242,-90.0795131,4.0,"This place has a little bit of a lot of different things and a lot of everything you would need to prepare any alcoholic delights you may want to mix up at your place or hotel. I was particularly grateful for their healthy supply of crackers, cheese and kid-friendly snack foods."
124,Burger King,30.0237812,-90.06177650000001,20.5,"Fucking piss poor service  mediocre food  This burger king need not too be in service any longer. Don't  even bother on wasting your time  eating here nor stopping at this establishment unless you have to use the rest room.  I rather eat gas station food, fast food Isn't not rocket science  HOW DO YOU SCREW UP  MEAT,  BREAD ,CHEESE AND TOPPINGS      just PATHETIC"
356,Haifa Cuisine & Hookah Bar,29.978933,-90.107866,3.5,"SO SLOW , slow is fine when you expect to stay there for an all night party but when you want to just have a quick bite to eat its lame. The wait staff is friendly but not educated on the menu. It seems like they hire people so that they can get experience in serving. The food is okay but takes forever to get to you.   The last time i went there with my boyfriend we were seated relatively quickly. The waitress came up after about 10 mins to ask what we wanted to drink. By that time we had already looked at the menu and ordered food and drink at the same time. We waited for about 45mins- 1 hour and still havent been given anything.  We sit there some more and the waitress comes over with our food. Then she askes if we would like anything else with that. We said yeah.... our drinks!!!! We sat there for at least an hour with nothing to drink and nothing to snack on. This place takes forever.  The prices are ok. Not to crazy over their one hookah per 2 people rule. If you go there with a group of 3 people they make you pay for a 2nd hookah even though the 3rd member of your group dosnt smoke and isnt 18 yet. That is absolutely ridiculous.  The atmosphere is nice and well thought out and the music is at a nice level.  Try this place for yourselves, i havent been in about a month so hopefully it has gotten better since the last few times i have gone. I, however will not be returning anytime soon.  Ps they have a great yogurt cucumber dip that is absolutly amazing. That alone is worth a star on here in my book."
745,Domilise Po-Boys & Bar,29.9174,-90.11236600000001,18.0,We tried Killer Po-Boys and Johnny's Po-Boys but this was hands down my favorite! The Surf and Turf was amazing. I can't wait to go back!
1936,We Bite Rare & Unusual Plants,29.970335,-90.0542246,18.0,"What a nice treat it was to visit We Bite! I came for a plant workshop that centered learning about different carnivorous plants. Carlos, the owner was so welcoming to my sibling and I. He walked us around the shop and answered all of our questions about the best pots/plant pairing for our the small bog gardens we were going to create. I forgot to get his colleagues names but they led us through a step by step workshop for adding and packing soil into our pots, drainage systems and tubes and what works best for particular pots and allowed time and space for us each to arrange our gardens. I personally made one for my Mother who I will be able to share with her on Mother's day. This was the perfect outing because it was short and sweet and who doesn't love basking in the presence of all the plants! I loved walking around the shop and admiring the variety if plants and I give the shop and thumbs up for honoring covid-19 protocols and having customers mask up during the entire workshop. They even went above and beyond to give each small group their own table and work space! Looking forward to more workshops this Spring and Summer. They also have a cool ""sale"" section with an assorted of plants which was neat to poke around in. I'll definitely be back."
3340,Walmart,30.0053065667,-90.0390863106,17.0,"I do agree with Haley about the parking lot cart men; they are friendly and always speak to me. They deserve 5 stars!   Although, that's the only part of this WalMart that deserves that. Being right around the corner from my home, I visit often. It's unstaffed, unorganized, and dirty. Employees are impossible to find and whenever you do find them they seem to hate their jobs meaning they hate you for needing help.   I understand that this is WalMart and I'm not expecting all-star service with smiles 24/7 but I am expecting a little more."
870,Casamento's Restaurant,29.9205946,-90.1010561,17.0,"A must-stop, oyster lover or not. The green and yellow tiled, and I mean head to toe, interior is gorgeous. It's from another time and totally unique at the same time with beautiful first-generation flourescent light fixtures that make it very bright but still warm. The same people have been serving and shucking since before I was born and the food is really pretty great."
1641,The Café on 11,29.949959000000003,-90.0696767,16.0,"I had no idea there was a restaurant on the 11th floor.  That being said,  I got the fried pork platter with sausage and cabbage.   The food had no flavor.  The sausage tasted like a boiled hotdog.  Very disappointed.     $7.95 for the platter.  For the quality and amount I find it very overpriced.  Next time I'm in the bldg,  I will give it one more chance."
1040,Pearl Wine Co,29.9772614,-90.092699,19.0,"If you enjoy wine and interacting with those passionate about wine, this is your place. Leora, the new owner, does a great job of getting actual wine makers into the store to expound on their creations during tastings. The attitude of the staff makes it really easy to find a wine you will love. Love not like. There is a difference.   I saw this place before the new owner and it was really confused. There were tons of empty shelves. No real style. It it definitely needed some help. However, now it is amazing. She has removed a bunch of the racks that were clogging up the floor plan and replaced them with very comfortable casual seating. My favorite space is the new seating area towards the back of the store. I really enjoy going and sinking into one of the plush chairs with a glass of wine after a long day."
1860,New Orleans Silver and Gold,29.953043466599997,-90.07311750000001,22.0,I have been dealing with Alex for almost a year and I must say it is a very secured place to sell your previous metals and diamonds. Great guy pays the best prices in town and won't rest till will make you happy.  Thank you Alex.
1414,Touché Bar,29.9562854,-90.0657355,18.0,"During our trip we popped in to this cute establishment for a quick drink. The bartender was very enthused to see us. The drink prices were meh, the atmosphere was nice but nothing to keep us coming back. An unhappy employee sets the mood for the patrons."
1012,Gianna Restaurant,29.946403399999998,-90.0687853,2.0,"Beautiful space.. Smart, polite staff. The food was excellent. We were a group of five and tried several different dishes. The meatball and the tuna appetiser were excellent.. and so was everything else that followed. Cant wait to go back!!"
2385,Union Market,29.9713684,-90.10638890000001,20.0,"This place is hands down THE BEST!!! Long story short...we flew in late last night feom Miami so I wasn't able to send my husband to work with his lunch ready but I thought ""no biggy, I'll get Waitr to deliver"", well Waitr SUCKS because I called Union Market to make sure they received my order and they've been waiting for Waitr to fix their system for over a week bc they can't see what's been ordered... anyway, that's another 1 star review on Yelp I'll be posting....thankfully I found out on time and I ordered through  DoorDash (another Yelp review for later but it will be 5 stars) the person who helped me at Union Market was a super nice guy named Gabriel Garcia, he seriously went above and beyond the call of duty to make sure Union Market did their part to get my husband's lunch on time because I explained that his lunch time can only be between 12-12:30 so he took it upon himself to contact DoorDash to see why at 11:30 it hadn't been picked up, to my surprise he called ME to let me know not to worry because someone was on their way but if they weren't there within 5 minutes he would call me to let me know and to see if we could figure something else out(who does that???) no one that's who!!!....thankfully there was no need because DoorDash pulled through like a champ and I just spoke to my husband and his lunch was AMAZING!!!! So needless to say I highly recommend UNION MARKET and DoorDash so if you're ever in a bind in the New Orleans/Metairie area call and ask for Gabriel Garcia at Union Market because he is THE BEST.!!!  On a final note I just want to thank whoever owns, manages or supervises UNION MARKET for employing people like Gabriel, he really is awesome."

3475,Wasabi Sushi  and Bar,29.9665653,-90.0581222,4.0,"Everything we ordered was amazing. Honey shrimp, tuna roll and the shrimp tempura roll are all a must. I'm glad we went. Fast and friendly service. I will definitely return when I come back to the fabulous city of New Orleans."
2969,Elysian Seafood,29.969390899999997,-90.0521636,18.0,"Food is good, but quite overpriced. It's tourist oriented, not locals oriented. Just paid $14 for a small piece of fish over raw grape tomatoes. Contrast this with the Good Bird vendor where one can get a very large 1/4 chicken (hormone free, etc) and two sides (a big meal) for two bucks less. I'll stick to the chicken."
1139,The Mill,29.960655500799998,-90.20138821399999,7.0,"The Mill is my go to bar in the Elmwood/ Harahan area of Jefferson Parish. The bartenders are great and so are the prices. The owner and his staff make all feel welcome and all of the natural wood items on the interior, walls and ceilings, are  interesting and add ""warmth"" to the fun relaxed atmosphere. The one down side is that it can get smoky on occasions when a lot of cigarette smokers show up. Darts, pool tables, poker machines and a video golf machine as well."
3273,Picayune Social House,29.9503434,-90.06885340000001,19.0,"We 3 out of towners Loved this place! Great drinks, food and service. We will be Back for sure! The burger and fries, gyro and chicken piscayne was amazing!"
2145,Bonjour Lingerie,29.920714,-90.099509,20.0,"Today was the first day I had a lingerie need and they followed through!  In all honesty I will admit I know, on an acquaintance level, one of the owners through mutual friends. When I contacted them today to walk me through buying lingerie for a bachelorette party gift, Angelique was beyond helpful. She walked me through the entire store showing me everything in the range I wanted to stay within. I found what I hope to be the perfect gift for my friend and will return for any other necessities.   *she also followed me out of the store when I almost left my favorite umbrella there. GREAT customer service!"
2606,McDonald's,30.038396000000002,-89.97567102309999,18.0,I like this McDonalds experience better than the other one south of this exit. I got a lady who offered me a job and met someone studying here. Haha. Good place to just chill. Right off the highway and convenient.
904,Subway,29.9463438,-90.11334240000001,16.0,The workers are extremely rude and unfriendly. Will drive to another SUBWAY to give my money to another franchise owner. DONE.
1809,Paint and Jrink,29.9637997,-90.0571718,16.5,"First off you guys you have to find parking. But don't let that one bad issue turn you away from this fun experience. Yes, it was an experience. I really enjoyed myself. The vibe is really positive and fun. The owner was very welcoming and he understood that everyone there were first time painters. He gave us kind of a mini-tutorial about using the different types of brushes and the effects they have on your drawing and the canvas itself. I really appreciated that he was willing to sit through and give everyone advice when needed on how to perfect their Masterpieces. Even though there were alcohol and food many of us still got our masterpieces finished.I felt like a real artist!!! I am looking forward to going back in the new year because I had too much fun!!"
303,Tsunami Sushi,29.949965999999996,-90.069677,14.0,"Pleasantly surprised by the presentation of the nice selections.  If I were not here for a biz trip, I would be planning my next visit back!  Good food!"
1095,K Joe's,29.956695899999996,-90.0666355,9.0,Very Mediocre food. Our group of four was disappointed with the food. The waiter was very nice and anxious to help but the meal was not great. My vegetables were way over cooked. The mango on my tilapia tasted like it was chopped the day before and had little flavor. The mashed potatoes were dry and the fish over cooked. The rest of my group had similar reactions to their food. Sorry we didn't go back to a number of the other restaurants we previously enjoyed.
437,Fat Cat Flowers,29.9579,-90.09536999999999,17.5,"Beautiful flower arrangements! Diane, the owner, knows her stuff and gave us great suggestions for our big day. The only gripe was that the decor wasn't as full as we expected for the ceremony. We expected a bit more for the price."
2898,Big Daddy's Bar,29.965032300000004,-90.0514523,5.5,This is MY bar in the neighborhood. My Cheers.  I love every single one of their bartenders and they show saints games on Sundays complete with pudding shots (YES PUDDING SHOTS) after every touchdown.  Mimis can kiss it with their pretentiousness and handle bar mustaches. Ive spent MANY MANY nights working out my lifes problems at Big Daddies. OH and they are 24 hours. Nah. Run tell THAT!  Love you guys!
3202,Bootleggers Bar and Grill,29.953112,-90.066366,5.0,"Went to Antoine's without reservations on a Friday night...so they suggested we go here while we waited and they'd get us.  Big mistake (for Antoine's...).  We were originally just going to get drinks, but then the caprese salad looked good, and then the duck and andouille gumbo looked good, so we ended up ordering these as well.  The duck gumbo could have used more duck, but except for that, it was quite tasy.  The caprese was good, though it suffered a little in the presentation (thick slabs of mozzarella...)."
3442,Save A Lot,29.9427597,-90.09585179999999,15.5,"Save A Lot is a good place to grocery shop for sheer  convenience. I shop there quite often for things I may need for the moment. I'm giving this 3 stars merely because of the selection they have. I might be worth while, but I lacks with certain things.  This location in particular, doesn't really pay attention to the products they sell. Check the expiration dates thoroughly. You may end up with something expired a few weeks to months ago."
938,Mask Factory,29.955491499999997,-90.0640132,18.0,"Huge selection of mask, boas and stuff.  T-shirts of all kinds.  If you want something to remind you of NOLA, this is the place to go!.  I never had any trouble with any employees."
1994,Bar Mon Cher,29.957204629099998,-90.06724300360001,5.0,"A 2-story converted bar off the main, busy and crowded touristy Bourbon Street; this place was distinctively quiet and non-touristy where we went to meet our friend who lives in NOLA.  This place is perfect for a group meeting or to get a drink with a group of friends.  It used to be a mansion and they've kept the look and feel of a southern residence.  The furniture, decor, and inviting fireplace all gave the feel of coziness or familiarity in a wealthy vacation bungalow.  The night we went the upstairs was blocked off so just the downstairs was available, and people were lounging on the sofas deep in conversation.  The drinks were strong and well made, the bartender friendly.  She said that the place didn't close and she would be working all night long but it was a quiet night so she was enjoying herself.  This particular bartender had Twilight Zone tattoos all over her arms and was obviously a huge fan.    Overall a good place to break off from the chaos of Bourbon Street just a few steps away if you want to get a quiet drink."
1008,Walgreens,29.9564631115,-90.1204385159,14.0,"Thank you Walgreen for being open at 2am when I need Excedrin, a pair of sandals and some Reese's Cups. You may not be the cleanest, but you are there. And if I have enough time, I may even stay and hang out just to watch the crazy bum activity/entertainment outside or inside your store.   You may have terrible services and your staff may be nice or naughty depending on the day, but that's not why I need you. In this murky town where everything closes early, you are there for me. It would be nice if there were more, but I can't expect much more. Just stay open. That's all I ask."
3422,DTB,29.948376899999996,-90.13067,17.0,This place is a jewel! The Crispy Duck entree is incredible!!! All the flavors on the plate came together is the most magically delicious way.

3377,Burger King,29.983195150500002,-90.1055147171,12.0,"This location of Burger King is really no different than any other Burger King.  It's truly the case of ""if you've seen one, you've seen them all.    Located in the Park Avenue Place strip mall near the intersection of City Park Avenue and Orleans Avenue, this location caters to Delgado Community College students as well as residents in ""South"" Lakeview and ""north"" Mid City.  I've been here several times and have always received courteous service.  There is a drive thru, but parking is limited in the often congested lot.  The dining room is quite large, but can still get quite packed during school hours."
759,Publiq House,29.9347827,-90.10511340000001,3.0,"Thursday evenings with Jenn MF Howard is worth the visit!  Inside looks a bit janky, and barmaids are overly ""generous"" with ice."
2796,Prime Example Jazz Club,29.983860015900003,-90.0715789795,5.0,"Definitely a hidden treasure. The gumbo is made perfectly and traditionally, loaded baked potato is to die for, and the red beans and rice were great too with sausage. I enjoyed the music while we ate and then some women put on an amazing skit to shed light on the history of New Orleans Baby Dolls. It was a great night with good food and good entertainment! Glad I came here."

I walked straight to them to get them and take  them to the register as an African American guy with dreads and a beard yelled out "" we close in a minute "" and we said  "" no problem! "" I got to the register and he sighed really loud and kept on with an attitude so I put him in his place. And as we  left he said "" yeah I was irritated ""  No wonder this has a 1 star rating. Kisses from the girl in a green bodysuit!"
3101,Blues Jean Bar,29.920833299999998,-90.11629690000001,20.0,"This was my first time in the Blue Jeans Bar and I was very pleased.  Personally, I dread shopping for jeans - skirts are so much easier. I digress. The jean-tenders were very pleasant, helpful, and professional. These gals know their jeans!  I told them (vaguely) what I was looking for and the helpful staff pulled about 5 pairs for me to try on. They have a nice selection to choose from. One pair absolutely fit the bill and I was sooooo happy.  I figured that this ordeal would take at least an hour, but we were done in 30 or so minutes.  Bonus is that I snagged a pair that will NOT require alterations - hallelujah! They do recommend a place (Mimi's - not the Marigny bar) if you need alterations.  Thank you, to the kind staff at the Blue Jeans Bar for making this the easiest pants-buying experience to date. Hurray for new denim!  ps: I went in tonight to use a livingsocial deal before it expires, bet it will be a madhouse tomorrow."

202,Subway,29.955797533800002,-90.0813517,17.0,"So here recently the staff has apparently decided to just close up shop whenever they feel like it regardless of posted business hours, sometimes 7:30, sometimes sooner.  Makes you wonder if the owner or franchisee knows that.   The place improved for awhile and now it appears to be headed down hill again"
2143,Subway,30.0315706199,-89.9736428065,17.5,Found a nice little fly smashed on the bottom of my sandwich. I never practiced checking my subway sandwiches because it's made right in front of you. Luckily it was on the bottom when I unwrapped it.  They don't take cash sometimes and sometimes they don't take cards. There was a shortage on items and chips for at least 2 weeks. The insect incident was the final draw for me. I never got an apology for my meal. Never going back.

Picked up the Coolinary whole rotisserie chicken dinner for 4 and a charcuterie board kit. Over the top! So fresh and delicious! The chicken was cooked to perfection, Brussel sprouts, potato salad and tomato cucumber salad were amazing. The rosemary ice cream, included, was a palate pleaser. Loved the charcuterie board too. Lovely selection of meats, cheese and the accompaniments. Enjoyed by all. Can't wait to place my next order."

This is the place for you. Home to both bestsellers and obsure texts, Maple Street Book Shop will please your literary side. The employees are willing to bend over backwards (sometimes literally...it's a small place) to help you find what you need. Be sure to take a free peppermint and bumpersticker on your way out.

All served by a very friendly bar mixer!  The interior is fun and has its own interpretation of a Tiki bar, my two girl-friends and me had a fantastic evening. there is no more to say then:   YES YES YES I LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!!  Perfect for a group of friends or a romantic date. Everything is right!!! Don't miss it if you are living in New Orleans or visiting.   The French Quarter Tiki bar is small enough to keep an intimate ambience, and big enough to party with your friends.  Beautiful-Non-Commercial!!! Tiki Tolteca would become one of my regular hangout, if I were a New Orleaner :-)  Enjoy!!! :-)"

We tried to get into the sports bar next door for the NFL playoffs but it was packed.  We found ourselves at Tahyo and spent most of the day there.  The drinks were so good, the food fresh and delicious, and the staff friendly.  Would absolutely go back if ever in NOLA again."

The male clerk (blonde hair, don't know his name) even considered that we would be traveling and recommended us buy a product online because we couldn't travel with it. He was funny and very knowledgeable. Great introduction to Hoodoo."

Pralines made on the spot.. great fudge and a cool building.. enter on Decatur, exit on Peter's.  They are so friendly you can taste your way right through the shop. So we did.  We also bought too much. Which we ate... and then wished we had more.  A worthwhile side trip, it kind of made our day!"
1633,Nola Good Eats,29.9421104,-90.0668795,18.0,"Was sad to see NOLA Grocery go but glad another sandwich shop took its place.  I ordered a ham and cheese po-boy. The menu said ""Bread: Dong Phuong Bun or Wheat,"" so I chose the Dong Phuong bun. It was not anything like the Dong Phuong po-boy bread that I've eaten at any Vietnamese restaurant. Instead of having a light tan, hard, crackly, crispy, exterior, this bread was deep brown and soft. It was almost exactly like the Pepperidge Farm sub sandwich rolls that I get at the grocery except these were a different shape. The inside didn't have the ""bubbles"" that are usually present in French bread - it was ""cottony,"" like a bun.   Perhaps Dong Phuong now offers a bun to their commercial customers, in addition to their banh mi bread? NOLA Grocery did say bun.  But If the sandwiches are going to be advertised as ""po-boys,"" then a certain type of bread must be used. If not, just call them ""subs.""   Hopefully the new owners will consider the feedback from the locals. I'm willing to give it another chance. The place is a lot cleaner than NOLA Grocery was and prices are okay."
1999,Kubi's Bar & Cafe,29.950875099999998,-90.06648009999999,6.5,"Kubi's came to the rescue when I needed to grub on a late night. Not many people in there which got me puzzled as to why it took a while for the bartender to acknowledge me at the bar.  She seemed cool, after I put myself out there and got my food in good timing. I had a sandwhich modified with chicken & it had a creatively good peppercorn dressing on it with fries. I can say nothing wrong about the food, and the price was decent.  I'll give the standard 3 stars due to customer service and minor un-cleansiness, but I will say it's a spot to visit if you need that late night stomach pleaser."

First the staff is super friendly and helpful , extremely patient at explain the menu and their sauces. Gave good recs on their wings. The wings were cooked to order and very tasty! I like mines on the spicier side and was very pleased. Would definitely come back here. Only down side is it's more catered for take out, small countertop seating inside."
555,Deanie's Restaurant & Bar,30.0383103,-90.0092902,17.0,"From Grilled Redfish to Stewed Rabbit, this place serves up great local food, that is as it has always been. Get the specials. Get the remoulade Sauce as your salad dressing. Yes, it is worth the drive out to the east. This will be evidenced by the variety of people dining here. From police to attorneys to hunters to plant workers."

Items on the shelf are usually in place and accessible upon your visit.  Sometimes the lines can be a little excessive, but check out in cosmetics or photo is usually an option.  The pharmacy is not the most swift, but they aren't the slowest either.  Nothing in particular is super good or super bad about this location...it's just OK!"

They came with a two different hot sauces and were covered in pickled cabbage. Absolutely delicious. The man who was working the register was extremely nice and seemed gracious for the business. I'll definitely be back."
2054,WOW Café,29.9761,-90.099526,18.0,"Meh.  40 bucks for two cokes, an app and 25 wings?  They have a large selection of sauces, but none of them are spectacular.  Food is decent quality, but nothing special, kind of like a Chili's.  We go here for football games occasionally because they are never very busy.    Service is generally friendly and helpful.  Next time I need to remember to go for the chicken tenders tossed in sauce rather than wings because it's the same price and I would hope you get more chicken.  Once upon a time they had beer specials during football season, but I didn't see anything about it recently. Like I said, meh."
1303,Gentilly Vision Source,30.000842,-90.058293,19.0,"Great place for quick service, and people who work with you.  They give you their prices up front.  That being said, you should know early on that portions of the bill must be paid in full.  They will wait until you have placed your order and are getting the bill to explain this.  The exam(s) can be split into payments, but the cost of items (glasses and contacts) must be paid in full.  Basically, at the end I was asked if I would prefer to pay half of my bill up front and then given a bill for two-thirds up front."
1722,Pho Tau Bay Restaurant,29.9562764733,-90.0789572114,18.0,"First off, 2 stars isn't bad; as yelp says, it's ""meh. I've experienced better."" Maybe it's cause I had high expectations already since apparently one of their menu items was on ""Best Thing I Ever Ate"" for Emeril?  Anyway, we shared a Bahn Mi, and I asked for no mayo on half the sandwich cause I personally strongly dislike mayo on anything. When we got our sandwich, there was mayo on the whole thing, and when we tried to ask what happened, one of the ladies in the kitchen said it's good with the mayo so that's why she didn't take it off and for me to just eat it with the mayo. Umm... I know I don't like it, and it's not my first viet sandwich, so I wasn't really too happy with eating something that I know wasn't my preference...  So then we got our main dishes. My bf had the pho ga [pho with chicken; the dish that Emeril proclaimed was one of the best things he ever ate], and he was pretty disappointed, but at least his stomach felt better after (he had a stomach ache). I tried the chicken in the pho, and it was, again, meh. I had bun [rice noodle salad] with eggroll and beef, which was pretty good, but I was kinda not too happy already so it wasn't as enjoyable as should have been.  Maybe it was an off day?"

I try my best to not leave bad reviews but the place had weird vibes ontop of other things and I hoped for better. I'm sure this place works for some tourist, but not for this one. The best way to see how you feel about it is to check it out for yourself. Maybe you'll have a better expirence than me, happy Nola adventures!"

They always have new items and one of a kind outfits, skirts, tops, dresses, hats, jewelry, belts and so much more. The store is welcoming and always clean. The owner goes out her way to help customers and prices items fairly. This shop is a must go to, even if you are just browsing, because the clothes are colorful and beautiful!"
1408,Agave Week,29.948331500000002,-90.0718664,11.0,"This event was even better than I imagined. I learned more about agave and how it relates to tequila during a short seminar than I learned during my lifetime.   El Tesoro is a remarkably tasty tequila that takes tequila crafting seriously. It's not only a quality tequila, but it is also a brand that sources agave responsibly. I had no idea that this coveted plant was over harvested to the point where it threatened the environment. The long-nose bat, the tiny mammal responsible for pollinating agave plants has reportedly recovered from near extinction, in part because of the efforts of responsible agave harvesters. The bat requires mature plants to pollinate, so El Tesoro allows 5% of their harvest to mature in order to protect this precious species. Even if it means they reduce their profit in the process. Now, that's something to toast to!  Following the seminar, I was invited to attend the Night in Paradiso event which was a blast! I was able to sample many varieties of El Tesoro, and I even made my own cocktail rim of herbs to take home. The night was enhanced by the smooth sounds of the Vivas band, and a delicious cooking demo by Restaurateur of the Year Edgar Caro! All in all one of my favorite events attended as a Yelper."

2358,Simply CBD,29.968411800000002,-90.0548083,20.0,"Simply CBD has a gigantic selection of CBD products and I was amazed at how helpful and knowledgeable they were. I've been interested in trying CBD for a while but wasn't sure where to turn because a lot of stores that sell it seem sketchy. I stopped by while I was in town for a wedding on the recommendation of a friend and couldn't have been more impressed. I picked up a pack of CBD gummies and chocolate covered pretzels and a bottle of Select CBD oil with peppermint flavor. Great experience, super reasonably priced even compared to online! They ship products anywhere in the country, so excited to order more!"
1458,Nola Art Bar,29.968394300000003,-90.0573564,2.0,Its a Tuesday through Sunday kind of spot for my friends and I. Perfect first date or even space to have a party. Drinks are the best and customer service is great every time I've patronized this place.
845,Papa Kitchen,29.9728949543,-90.0605897224,11.0,"I like this place a lot. Staff has always been kind and the food is really good. They raised some of their prices recently (bummer), but it's still pretty reasonable. I recommend."
2495,QUEORK,29.9589047,-90.0623432,20.0,"Interesting concept and I did manage to buy a wallet for the bf since they claimed that the cork material is waterproof. It seems to be holding up well so far.   The only disappointing thing I experienced when I was in the store was that everything I wanted was out of stock. I could have bought more, but I felt like none of the shoes in my size were in stock, along with the dog leash, etc. Although I could wait for it to get back in stock in their online store (since I don't live in New Orleans), it's not exactly the same because I like to see and touch it in person if I'm in the store."

We decided we stopped by on our way home from picking her up from the airport and the place was packed so we decided to get it to go. Our order consists of The Feast, 10 lbs of crawfish on medium heat and an order of fried calamari  thought we might've ordered too much food but boy were we wrong fried calamari smell so good that we had to dig in and couldn't stop eating bc it was light,  crispy and hot."

720,Vals,29.934811699999997,-90.10612409999999,18.5,"Went to Val's for their Happy Hour deals and really enjoyed it! Their margaritas were $6 instead of $10, and the chips and guac were a delicious appetizer!  Their tacos are pretty small, so I would order around 3 for a full meal. The fried fish tacos were the best! The chicken mole tacos weren't that great--the meat was pretty tough. The sweet potato tacos were also pretty good!   The only inconvenience would be that you can't really split checks, so if you're going with a larger group of people, make sure to have a plan on who's paying."

She chicken fried it and when her helper went to put just a few pieces on my bread, she scolded him and told him not to cheat me out of my meat. :)  A little Creole Mustard and I was worrying those poor chop bones at the end. Man that was good. probably the highlight of Bayou Boogaloo except for kora konnection and the ability to sign an anti-smoking petition. :)"

After walking around all day and not wanting anything too heavy NOLA Pho life was the best place I could have came upon. The owners were not only awesome and easy to talk to, they weren't closing up until every last customer was served.   I could seriously eat this everyday if they had a place in my city. So, if you need a little break from the great (but heavy) local cuisine try them out. Also, try their guava cilantro drink, very good on a hot day when you don't want anything alcoholic but want something cold and good. Although, it could be good with a little vodka. :-)"
1611,Winn-Dixie,29.9638424,-90.16287609999999,16.0,This is not the best Winn Dixie to do your grocery shopping. They don't have much of a selection and the staff is not friendly.

What I found was an attentive staff and a very pleasant, experienced eye doctor, not to mention affordable pricing. Being my first exam in some time, Dr. McDow took the time to fully explain each step of the procedure, as well as the results of my exam. She was very kind and patient and I would definitely recommend her to those in need of an eye doctor."

It was supposed to be a mother's day present to be given to her at her office across the street from Mitch's. I called just now, 10am on 5/9, and asked when I could pick up my arrangement. The assistant put me on hold for 2 minutes and came back on and said that Monique couldn't find any sunflowers because of the weather in California right now (interesting because fresh market has them as of last night). I responded with ""Well she wasn't going to call me and let me know?!"" Monique's assistant replies ""well she sort of totally forgot..."". I replied ""Awesome, thanks."" and hung up. I can't remark on the work she normally does, but I can't believe that not only did she not have the decency to get on the phone and apologize herself, but also didn't offer me any other options to rectify the situation. Off to Fresh Market I go, I guess. Thanks for nothin, Mitch's."

2131,Toast,29.9185016,-90.1164893,16.0,"I had the pleasure recently of having breakfast at Toast Uptown.  Toast is located on Laurel Street at the old Laurel Street bakery location.  Toast is less than a year old, and word has is definitely out on how good it is.  I knew to arrive early, or I'd have a wait in front of me.  We arrived at 9:30 and immediately found 2 seats at the bar.  The regular tables were all full, one with a party of 12 (tables pushed together).  None of the tables outside were occupied because it was still a little chilly outside.  The atmosphere at Toast is bright and cheerful, albeit small.  You're in pretty close quarters with everyone around you, but I'm fine with that.  My only complaint was that it was VERY LOUD.  They've put foam under the chairs and tables, but it didn't seem to be helping much.  Once the large party left, it got considerably better.  I find the prices at Toast to be extremely reasonable for what you get, with entrees ranging from $10-$14, and smaller side items (like toast topped with prosciutto, honey, and ricotta, or an order of ableskivers) going for $5-$8.    For my entrée, I had the croque madame.  It was huge and delicious, and was served with a light side salad.  My BF had the hangar steak topped with tarragon aioli, served with roasted potatoes and sunny side up eggs.  His meal was also fantastic.  I was really dying to try some of the ableskivers with lemon curd dip, but their portions are huge and there was just no way.    By the time we left 45 minutes later, there were 15 people outside waiting, and all outside tables were full.  I highly recommend Toast, but you might want to go before 10 if you don't want to wait."
723,Royal House,29.95647323,-90.06638605100001,16.0,"We waited about five minutes to get seated for the group of five, and we were seated upstairs. Our server was really friendly and gave us a quick rundown of the menu, and we got the crawfish beignet as an appetizer from the checking on Yelp. Apparently the appetizer isn't free like the Yelp check-in says but it's -$10 for whatever appetizer you get. Anyway, we ordered a bunch of food including two platters of oysters, and we then we started waiting. And waiting. After maybe twenty minutes, our first platter of oysters came, closely followed by the second plate. We noticed the second plate wasn't what we ordered so we asked the waiter who took it back. We then waited for another twenty or thirty minutes for our food, and our entrees came. Our oysters never did. We told the waiter and he said there was a mixup and our oysters were given to the table next to us. The manager came by afterward and told us that she'd give us two orders of what we got on the house (too bad I don't really eat oysters). So I ate my crawfish etouffee and it was quite good. A bit salty, but good. Nice spicy flavor and a good amount of crawfish, both fried bits on top and in the sauce. I asked for more bread as well so I could soak up the sauce. I quite enjoyed that dish. When the oysters finally came after we had already all finished our meal (this was probably another 10-15 minutes), the Rockefeller oysters came and I tried one. Way too much cheese on top! Otherwise I think ok as far as oysters go. Then we asked for the check do which also took at least five minutes to get here. My crawfish dish was $17 pre-tax which is a bit pricey, and combined with the mixup and the super long waiting times, I wouldn't suggest coming here. The waiter apologized many times for the mixup which is fine, but it doesn't excuse the super long wait times for our main entrees. To be fair, my food (the crawfish etouffee) was quite good and deserves 4 stars, but the long long long wait and inefficiencies (I'm excusing the mix-up with the oysters because there was a miscommunication which I understand happens - what isn't excusable is how long we waited for our entrees/other dishes, the check, etc etc) subtracted 1 star."

I always leave wishing I had a really small size foot bc that's where alot of the great deals are (lucky girls with size 5-6). A couple of weeks ago I was looking for a Pella shoe that I fell in LOVE with.  They researched it for me and although they were not able to get it, they let me know when they promised they would.  I'll be back!"
2196,Pizza Delicious,29.962418710100003,-90.0428899696,16.0,Had a large pepperoni  and a large marghuerita pie.  They were good.  Very close to a new york style crust--but not quite there(native NYer)  Tasty red sauce.  Decent prices.  The house salad looked great for 6 bucks.  Parking was easy.  Bathrooms were clean.  Nifty dinner plates.  Will probably head back sooner or later.  NY crust when pizza is first cooked.  Turns into a cracker after it gets cold...
2536,Bourbon O Bar,29.9590515552,-90.0651563866,4.0,"Not only is this by far the best Bourbon street bar if you want real drinks and you don't drink like a 20 something.  But their selection of brown liquor is one of the best i've seen.  Scotch, Bourbon, some nice tequila, and sipping rums.  The bartender has put great thought into the liquor on their bar and it shows.  Didn't make it for any music but both times it was subdued no rowdy idiots.  If you like to drink and I mean really drink without the spinning wheels of a daiquiri machine in the background this is the place to go.  Don't count on a handgrenade or a hurricaine but if you want one they will make it from scratch."

3395,Cafe Degas,29.9803386,-90.0841949,16.0,A very enchanting atmosphere. Got the special ravioli which was awesome. Fiancé forgot the strip steak and licked his plate. The green apple sorbet was the perfect ending.
1223,Five Below,29.9594129191,-90.1868091233,19.0,"I'd like to consider myself a nifty thrifty shopper and am probably too familiar with the stock in most every Dollar Store in town so when I heard of 5 Below I jumped at the chance to find some solid deals for less than a Lincoln.  So if I were a Mom or had an epic sweet tooth or liked worked out gear, I think I'd be more about this stock. I wish they had more crafting, gift wrapping, storage, and items that would be useful for work.   On some items, it made sense for it to be $5 and others it just didn't. I'm sure I'll go back again. This time around I purchased some battery-powered lanterny lights and USB chords ('cause you can't have enough USB chords)."
3186,Black Label Icehouse,29.932152600000002,-90.09006109999999,4.0,"Those wicked pickles, that smoky brisket and bacon wrapped jalapeños stuffed with cream cheese you say? Count. Me. In.  Black Label BBQ fed a few of our Yelpers at our end of the year bash and ran out of food tout de suite. So fast, in fact, that although I arrived fairly early, it was already devoured by the time I made it to the table.  Well, of course I had to see what the fuss was about. We headed there less than a week later.  BLBBQ is located inside of Barrel Proof. It's a pop up but it's not that easy to find once you're in there. We had to look around a bit before we noticed it and it's really dim in there so that makes it challenge. Walk in and head straight back and slightly over to your left you'll notice the hostess stand where you go right up and order. It's opposite the bar, if that helps. Place your order and cross over to the bar for a beer (Bloody Mary) and have a seat at one of the many tables. The hostess will then bring out your death by BBQ.   I really liked the brisket...the flavor was incredible, but it was a little dry. The poppers were wonderful and my friend stole all but one because they were that good. Those pickles? Sweet Baby Jesus. They were so good. I am not above stalking the chef for that recipe. Ain't no shame in the wicked pickle game."
1436,The Famous Door,29.956265000000002,-90.06799000000001,5.0,"loved this place so much we went both nights we were there. Live band that plays covers of popular songs (first night we went it was 80s/90s rock, next night it was hip hop and r&b.) Great spot to dance and sing along. beers are reaonably priced and served in a large bucket on the side of the bar. Watch out for the shot girls - one of them is pretty aggressive and shoves your face in her chest when you've taken the shot."

We ordered the hand grenades rather than pore over the menu. There was a band playing so we decided to sit for a bit Holy cow on those drinks!! They were $9 each (with souvenir cup) and we were really feeling it towards the end of the drink. It was during the day and we were enjoying the nice weather and band playing. This place was on the corner of Bourbon, close to Jackson Square and there was lots of open air coming through. We were singing along with the band which is an indication of how good that drink made us feel, lol. We had a lot of fun, good atmosphere in that bar."

1288,Cafe Lafitte In Exile,29.9603886292,-90.0642254949,6.0,"Fifi's, as I affectionately call Cafe Lafitte's, is a favorite of mine in the Quarter. They always have cheap drinks and don't skimp on the stiff pours. I feel that they generally attract an older, male crowd compared to the Pub, Oz, and Good Friends down the street.   There is an upstairs area that gets a little more risque depending on the night. I have seen full male nudity up there and people get handsy. No photography upstairs or you'll be shown the door. There is a nice balcony to look out over the street and they broadcast pop and dance music videos on the wall of Clover Grill."
1275,Cafe Beignet,29.9597216,-90.0601658,18.0,"Cafe DuMonde is HORRIBLY recommended and a tourist trap.  Cafe Beignet is great for a quick, cheap breakfast or an amazing order of beignets.    Fresh, tasty, not over surgared.  No attitude or blank-expression service, no sticky floor.  Just good, honest food."

1115,Hank's Bar,29.969815000000004,-90.067003,10.0,"Man, the first thing that caught my eye as the driver dropped us at our Tremé apartment was Hank's up on the next corner. True, classic hole-in-the-wall dive. Whatever they made, I had to have me some. So much that it detoured us from our mission to Li'l Dizzy's around the corner. Alas, not open at 1:30 in the afternoon. That gave me time to Yelp it and learn that the day you really want to eat here is Thursday when they make the seafood baked potatoes.  Everybody else wanted Italian on Thursday, so I decided to get a couple of those potatoes to go for later. 6:00 I go in there and the joint is hoppin'!  R&B music we could hear 2 doors down, folks spilling out onto the corner to smoke and drink. It's a true, blessed hole in the wall-concrete floor, dark walls, ceiling painted black except for the pieces of particle board stuck up there for some reason. You order your food at the window in the back and have a seat while a server bags up orders, hunts you down and collects your money; I don't know how she kept everybody straight, but she did.  A potato with seafood and crab meat is $12 with tax, and one would make a light meal or big side for two people. The potatoes are cooked just right, covered with shrimp and crabmeat in an étouffée-like sauce with a delayed afterburn that's not overwhelming. I loved it! They also have fried fish and chicken, and some other items I didn't pay attention to because I only had eyes for the potatoes."
1396,Vegan Snack Shack,29.943504100000002,-90.09755030000001,11.5,"I ordered the Judaea Burger. The burger patty is too soft, so paired with their hard, chewy buns, it was a challenge to eat. The overall taste was just okay. No flavor stands out except for bbq sauce.  I also had the Nazarene Nachos, which were better than the burger, but still kind of uninteresting. It's quinoa and chips on a bed of lettuce with some sauce. The quinoa was perfect, the lettuce was crisp, the chips were serviceable, and the sauce was just a little too salty. I wish there was more going on with these nachos. I did have two tiny chunks of tomato at the bottom of my bowl, so maybe my order just came out unfinished.  For the price I was expecting more. Stronger flavors and better preparation are needed here. Also, they used Styrofoam boxes for their deliveries, which seems odd for the brand of a vegan restaurant."
2601,Horus EatDat,29.959438676100003,-90.0764169948,17.0,"Went outside expecting to see Queen on Wheels, but found this food truck in it's spot instead. So I gave it a try. I ordered the Philly Steak and Cheese combo, which cane with fries and a canned drink for $10. If you use a credit card, they charge sales tax; so pay by cash to avoid the additional $1.   Overall, the meal was fine. The sandwich was about a foot long filled with meat, cheese and peppers. It was light on mayo and I wished there had been more. While the fries were dusted with what looked like creole seasoning, they still lacked flavor. However, they were hot, crispy and plentiful. When I make fries at home, I just use salt and pepper and they are the bomb.com. For some reason these fries were missing something and I couldn't figure out what. Fat maybe? Or maybe it was the particular brand.   The filling was tasty, but I think I would've preferred po-boy bread because the hoagie was chewier than I would've liked. But then it would've been a po-boy and not a Philly cheesesteak. Compared to Subway, the combo was a great deal.  Service was fast, but the cashier/owner (I'm assuming) was kind of dry and could have been friendlier."
2235,Bar B Q Kings,29.996701,-90.059759,20.0,"Even though this place is known for Barbecue I get the smoked fish, macaroni, and vegetables. There's also a beautiful smoked chicken salad available. It's on point every time. It's very cozy and welcoming and I like the music choices in this spot. I always enjoy myself whether the food is to go or I eat there."

Today I got my order via UberEATS and once it was delivered I noticed my order wasn't quite right. After THG was made aware of the mistake they hand delivered another meal, complete with a side of hummus and baklava! This is what excellent customer service is about - ""righting"" a honest mistake. I will always be a customer at this location!"

2462,Crescent City Books,29.954000300000004,-90.0667436,19.0,"Lovely, old-fashioned, mostly used with a handful of new books. They have a wide selection of maps and prints as well as books on all topics, ranging from cheap pocket paperbacks to gorgeous collectible art books.  You may well find something specific that you're looking for, but I like this bookstore better for books I didn't know I needed, and books that I didn't know existed.  Two floors, lots of places to sit and browse, obligatory friendly (but not underfoot) shop cat."
2860,Allwood Cabinets and Home Center,29.9649,-90.136413,20.0,"This is a filthy showroom located in a filthy warehouse. One of the other reviews says, ""Cheap and nice job."" I concur with the first part of the review.  The cabinets appear to be cheap. As you can see in the picture I posted, it appears that Sharpies are used to make the black lines on the cabinetry.    The colors on the cabinet doors are not the same color stain as is on the main cabinetry.  Perhaps, this is specific only to the floor models, I couldn't say. The woman watching television in the store, did not speak to us or acknowledge us.    There was a child about 4 or so roaming about the showroom, obviously a relative of the employee. (This is a pet peeve of mine) They were ducking in and out of the cabinets demonstrating how nicely the doors slam.    The employee did not speak English well enough to answer our questions regarding the cabinets. This would not be a problem ordinarily, but we were told repeatedly ""Come back later.""  No other information available, only "" You come back later."""
3132,District Donuts Sliders & Brew Lakeview,30.005086,-90.1094083504,17.0,"Kolaches and donuts are amazing. Coffee is pretty watery and borderline gross. Decor is awesome. Parking is a drag. Staff is friendly. Too many toddlers crawling on the walls. Great music. However, I understand when ""Thriller"" is being played it deserves to be dialed up. But god damn! It drowned out every conversation and sent half the restaurant to move outside just to talk. Maybe that was the goal. The music was never turned down after. It felt like bourbon street with toddlers and yoga pants."

I'm also a fan that they offer noon classes, for those of us that enjoy our morning routines, this is the perfect mid day addition.  They rotate teachers also so I was able to practice with a couple of different ones. I loved J.LOs class she offered a fantastic flow and incorporated tapping into our chakras.  This studio also offers a variety of non yoga classes such as astrology, painting, yoga and vino. It's such a beautiful space and I'm so happy they are inviting the community to come in and explore various classes. I would definitely recommend this studio! It's a neighborhood gem."

My family and I had reservations for 8:30 after a day at Jazz Fest.  We showed up a little early, let the hostess know we were all there, and decided to get drinks at the bar.  After seeing us at the bar, the hostess proceeded to give away our table.  We were not seated for another hour, and, let me tell you, you really want a seat and a good meal after a long day at Jazz Fest!  We tried to stay in good spirits, but even when we were finally seated, our server was a little too erratic and not very helpful.  The food was mediocre at best and not worth the price you pay.  We will not be returning.  The sad thing is this place used to be good! We went last year and returned with high hopes.  Maybe management changed because Rio Mar is definitely not the same."

1365,Above The Grid,29.9520107405,-90.0726522126,3.0,Apparently you must be a hotel guest to be able to visit this bar. We were in Nola for the weekend and I did a search for best rooftop bars and this was listed so we walked all the way there to enjoy a drink & the sunset. When we arrived there was a doorman and I explained that we would like to go to the bar and he said go ahead so we walked in and there was not anybody at the front desk or the concierge so we headed straight to the elevators. Once we got in there was a kind person that swipe their card for us so it tipped me off that maybe we needed special permission to go up there. When we arrived we began to  head past the bar to find a seat and a  security officer said that he needed our card. I explained that we were non-hotel guests and just wanted to enjoy a drink at the bar. He was extremely rude and non-communicative and would not even look at me. He just sat there and watched YouTube videos on his phone and refused to engage with me on any level.  I tried to be as friendly as possible and ask questions and he just grunted at me while continuing to watch videos on his phone. I asked him if he knew of any other places and basically refused to answer or even look at me. So we just turned around and walked away. It was extremely awkward and uncomfortable. Thankfully he was really the only ridiculously unfriendly person that we had come in contact with it in Nola during our stay. All I have to say is it was a very poor first impression and it definitely made me think twice to ever try going there let alone stay there and I would let everybody know about my experience. Disappointed that it was such a waste of time.

2557,Lakeview,30.004464008400003,-90.1080993935,14.0,Lakeview is one of the most modern areas of New Orleans and has a lower density of bars and restaurants.  This is one of the places where people move after they get married and have children so there are lots of families here.  There are some fun bars and restaurants in this area but it has a much more suburban feel than most of the other neighborhoods in New Orleans.  There are still many deserted houses here from Katrina and the area seems to be recovering slower than other areas but there are some fantastic deals on some nice modern houses that can appeal to many people.  This neighborhood also gives you the opportunity to live right next to Lake Pontchartrain and all the amenities that it offers.

A friend and I went to have dinner and catch up, but the only table we were offered was one along the wall squeezed in between 2 other tables VERY close to them. They sat us along the wall where we sat in bar stools even though there was a 4 top open. I just hate sitting in bar stools when I'm eating a nice dinner. The margarita was mixed perfectly & the lobster claws were divine, but I feel like it was a little overpriced. I'd go back regularly if everything was $2-5 cheaper."

Well, you're in luck because Uptown Costume has a very nice selection of them in sizes S, M, and L for around $30!!   Beautiful wig selection of short hair, long hair, curly hair, in a variety of fun colors. AND you can try them on, which is extremely helpful if you'd like to see what you'd look like with short neon green hair. (Don't be ashamed, I did too). I think the prices start on those at about $20 and up, mostly in the $25-$35 range.    Pretty reasonably priced accessories too! An assortment of tights for about $6 and fun vintage earrings (about $14 and under). Many are clip ons and you just might see the same pair on a drag queen.   My friend and I were basically having a small heart attack every aisle we turned at seeing the next fun thing. They have a bunch of costumes, but not really what I was in the store for, so I pretty much just ignored them and searched for the next shiny thing I could find.  YAY for Mardi Gras costume shopping!

I've yet to figure why, other than possibly being a model from a previous year, the sofa was on such a hard discount, but we got it for a really amazing price. Yeah, some of the stuff looks like it belongs in my grandmother's house (if she had been on the cast of Miami Vice that is - yeah, the original series), but most of the stuff was great  looking and pretty decent quality (for consumer grade furniture - sorry, this isn't custom handmade or hotel-level-durability stuff). make sure to check out the upstairs as well while you are there."

There's a lovely staircase in the middle of the store, and I noticed some couches occupied by some men, haha.  Sale section is on the 2nd floor, which is modestly-sized.  This location has housewares, as well as shoes.  We weren't greeted on upon entering the store from the street, but after visiting Saks Fifth Avenue, we were greeted on the way back in from the mall.  Overall, a nice location, much like other Anthropologie stores out on the west coast."
1766,Burger King,30.004450652600003,-90.0376280397,15.0,This is the worst BK I been to!!! I ordered a bacon chicken ranch salad and it had no bacon and almost no cheese.  They didn't even have the right container to put the salad in so they gave me 2 side salad bowls with Saran Wrap.
676,Hangout Ramen,29.948753049,-90.1285501,17.5,"I was a little hesitant to check this place out since it only had 1 review thus far, but glad we didn't let that deter us. We had been somewhere else and the menu only had 1 option that even looked good, so it was great when we got here and I immediately saw 4-5 things I was excited about.   We landed on the tuna and avocado roll, spicy kimchi udon, and teriyaki hot plate. I really appreciate that the roll was only $7.50 and the slices were not so large I felt like I needed to cut them, which isn't really possible with chop sticks. My udon was good although not spicy at all. The bf liked the teriyaki plate but just be aware that the meat is not cooked in the sauce so it may not be as strong of a flavor.   All-in-all we will definitely come back to try some Ramen and a few other things!"
1006,Bistro At Maison De Ville,29.957825,-90.065984,3.0,"Had the pleasure of dinning here during my vacation in NOLA. This place was amazing. It's right off of Bourbon Street, so it was not to hard to find when we went dining there a second time.   Everything that they prepared was delicious. The first time we went there, we ordered practically everything and cleared our plates, with still the hunger for more (even though the stomach couldn't take anymore). It was a shame though, since we did not have a chance to try there dessert. Or at least until we returned to indulge our sweet tooth before our flight.   I highly recommend this place, the servers were very friendly and attentive, the food was unbelievable, and the decor was very fitting."
803,Stella Umbrella,29.961390939,-90.0588940967,20.0,I guess this is by appointment only. I have tried twice in one day to purchase an umbrella for my mom. I was told they would open in 30 min. I come back an hour. Still not open. The lady told me I will open in 15 mins. They never did. It's too hot to stand around in the summer humid. Bad business.
316,Wasabi Sushi & Asian Grill,30.021375399999997,-90.11473670000001,17.0,"Came here with a group of girls, so we were able to order a bunch of different things to try.  I gotta say they made the best squid steak I ever had.  Flavor was amazing.    The only downside, was that the service was really slow, and everything is extremely over priced.  The food took forever to come out, and we had to wave the waitress down for drinks.  If we had gotten better service, and the prices not so high, I would have given them 4 stars."
2515,Cleo's Mediterranean Cuisine,29.952454,-90.06685,8.0,"The staff was so kind, friendly, and accommodating. They specially made so many menu items vegan and oil-free. The food is incredibly delicious! I couldn't recommend this place more- thank you, thank you, thank you for such a wonderful experience!"
1525,House Of Broel,29.933541100000003,-90.08089179999999,10.0,Toured the home and extensive collection of doll houses.  Amazing story about the beautiful home and history of owner.
2018,Isis Restaurant & Bar,29.9521039806,-90.07208704950001,17.0,"Two words: No Bueno. Poor service, small portions and a staff with no concept of time led to my first and last  experience at Isis. Restaurant owners in the CBD learn from Isis' mistake,  if someone orders a sandwich in the business district and it takes over an hour your going to lose your client base. Also, have your order ready they bullied my friend into a panicked order of chicken cordon bleu that he said he wouldn't  feed his dog and his dog is dead."
947,Legacy Kitchen Oyster Counter + Tap,29.9532441774,-90.0719013065,16.0,The fried oysters are amazing...  and the salmon with greens is even better.  Excellent food and fantastic service.  Everyone that works here is extra friendly which made it a wonderful experience.  We will definitely be back!
109,Pho Cam Ly,29.9211868,-90.0945189,18.0,After 3 weeks of working in the area I finally found a place off of Magazine that is not overrated. Friendly staff! Y'all know I love Phò so it's pretty damn good!
199,St Roch Kitchen,30.019358162600003,-89.96327066180001,16.0,"I ordered a Philly cheesesteak from here and it was just ok. There really wasn't a lot of meat on the sandwich to justify the price. The ""hot foods"" were all but gone, and the stuff that was there looked like it had been sitting under the heating lamp all day. If you do go, try to get there early as most of the good stuff sells out quickly."
1083,Walgreens,29.9397442794,-90.1038137,17.0,"Last time I will ever support this location.  Was there with my son (sick and less than two years old).  Son knocked over a bottle of baby shampoo as I was reading the difference between children's and infants tyelenol.  Lady 5 feet from me asked ""are you just gonna let him do that?""  I politely stated ""I'm not asking your opinion on how to raise my son.""  She lost it, started yelling and using profanity.  Staff from the Walgreens came and basically escorted me out because this lunatic was dropping the F bomb repeatedly in front of my 20mth kid.  I'm done with this place.  My wife was done with this place a year ago because all the loiterers and similar experiences.  I didn't really believe it was that bad till today.  I honestly think this place is racist towards hardworking white middle class.  I'm sure I'll get tore up for that comment but I'm alright with it cause you don't know me."
811,McKenzie's Chicken In A Box,29.997772899999998,-90.0601712,19.0,This chicken is addictive. I have had friends get mad at me for turning them on to McKenzie's because after this chicken nothing else measures up. Get the chicken. Get the shrimp fired rice. Get the mac and cheese. Get the fries! Don't get fried oysters or shrimp - there are other places that do this better. Eat the damn chicken! You have to get it to go. The smell of it will torment you for your drive home. We bring this to parties and now have people mad at us if we bring something else! They are now open for breakfast too - their fried chicken biscuits are the perfect morning after breakfast.  Eat The Damn Chicken!!!!
1027,Avenue Cafe,29.935803399999998,-90.0786298,16.0,We went to this place 4 times in our 3 day stay in New Orleans. The Best Orange Juice I have ever tasted!!! We kept coming back for more! Also try the bagel sandwich! Definitely cured the hangover from too many hand grenades on Bourbon St. the night before!
636,Wendy's,29.9400223,-90.1013483,17.0,"My two Asiago chicken ranch wraps had no asiago cheese, no bacon, and no tomato. Instead I received two wraps with chicken, lettuce, and cheddar cheese only. That was it. I asked for no ranch so I could use my own low-cal ranch and at least they got that right. How hard is it to make two wraps that are exactly like your menu states minus the ranch?  How can you get something so simple so wrong?  I worked fast food as a teenager and it's not rocket science folks. C'mon!"
43,District Donuts Sliders Brew,29.929425899999995,-90.0770687,17.0,"Fantastic sliders!! Perfect size that you can try more than one!  Fried chicken slider, BLT slider, monte cristo and Cuban were all fantastic!  Now for Donuts to go!!"
1762,Foot Locker,29.9533346523,-90.0700964,20.0,The ladies here were extremely nice and friendly.  They were more than happy to assist us.  They were very helpful.  I bought sneakers for my daughter and I.  Love our sneakers.
685,Pelican Bay,29.974788820300002,-90.05702318870001,17.0,"Absolutely the best pina colada daiquiri in town! I went there the other week and got 3 daiqs to go; they were all really good (and the long island daiquiri packed a punch), but it's the pina colada that will keep me coming back.  The bartender was really friendly. She offered suggestions, and gave me samples. One of the owners was hanging around too. The whole place had a very welcoming vibe.  I didn't get any food (which is the only reason I didn't want to go with a full 5 stars), but I'm excited to see they have vegetarian-friendly options. I'll be sure to sit down for a meal next time!"
2979,The Original Pierre Maspero's,29.9556758,-90.06520640000001,17.0,"Excellent drink options and flavor-packed food paired with a mood-lit rustic ambiance make The Original Pierre Maspero's a great spot for dinner. I had the crab cakes and they were perfection--from the amount of crabmeat and size of each cake to the remoulade drizzled on top, they are savory and totally worth stopping in for. I ordered a French Onion Soup app and it was the best I've ever had. 5/5 stars, look forward to returning."
1602,Louis XVI Restaurant,29.955108799999998,-90.0681337,2.0,Some of the best food we've had yet And what an AMAZING STAFF. 5 Golden Stars they deserve more. We had a great time and will be back. Again thanks New Orleans OMG
1332,Tropical Isle,29.9586815,-90.06489599999999,4.5,"You have to try a hand grenade, or two, if it's your first time visiting New Orleans...  ...you just have to!  Ask for an extra shot and see where the night takes you. That is all.  I didn't give it a 5 star because of feeling like I've been hit by a train the next day just about every single time."
2105,Mimi,29.920833299999998,-90.11629690000001,19.0,"As far as what other reviewers have said, I've made several purchases here of dresses, shoes, tops, and accessories.  It seems to be hit or miss as far as how I'm treated depending on what I'm wearing.  But it doesn't bother me; if I've ever needed assistance and didn't get it, I just asked.  Also, since I've become a regular customer, the salesperson I work with treats me great no matter what I'm wearing (duh).      I think their selection is wonderful, although some clothes are for older women.  But they carry Vince, Issa, Michael Kors, Jimmy Choo, Alexander McQueen, and many other designers who I love, and there's plenty of options for a 30-ish professional looking for a nice piece.  They also have an extensive selection of formal gowns and costume jewelry from good designers like Lulu Frost and Oscar de la Renta.  I get so many compliments on the gowns I've purchased from here--they're really showstoppers.  They're expensive, but they're the same price you'd pay for these designers anywhere else.    Maria is the seamstress, and she is very good, but expect to pay a good amount for the work.  They have great sales every now and then, and you can get a great deal on a luxury piece!"
1496,T-Mobile,29.977363696599998,-90.0970201977,20.5,"Aaron, Ryan and Leomia were awesome! Great customer service. Very friendly and helpful."
1472,Italy Direct,29.9543762,-90.0679879,16.0,"I loved this store! The customer service was excellent, I felt like a princess in there and the quality of the clothing was outstanding. I ended up spending way more than I should have, but I don't regret it at all! I think I will even shop from here online now that I'm back home."
2988,Milkfish,29.975316999999997,-90.100311,17.0,"Everyone was very nice and professional. They were a bit slammed but the service was still swift and the food came out in a reasonable amount of time.   Now for the food. I didn't go to the pop up when it was there, and I was very excited to eat the food. I am Filipino and I understand that everyone makes each signature Filipino dish differently. The food presentation was very good. But I would still encourage the chefs and the owner to punch up the menu; an issue I have with many asian restaurants in town is that they dilute the flavors that should be in the food. I had the lumpia shanghai [good stuffing but a bit limp in texture], chicken adobo [good portion size but needed to be marinated longer since the flavors of the sauce did not permeate the meat much], and milkfish [fried preparation and again, it needed more marinade flavor]. I can understand that Filipino flavors can be a love it or hate it thing and being a new restaurant, they're still figuring it all out. But if you are gonna have a Filipino restaurant, then make the unique flavors explode as they should. That's what makes Filipino food amazing. I will be back to try again - hoping I'll be wow-ed next time."
3068,MadChef at 59th Restaurant & Bar,30.0406903625,-89.9549502879,17.5,"I would've loved to give this place 5 stars and maybe they will be once they work out the kinks but it took over 30 min to get my salmon plate and when it came out my food was cold. Everything was tasty however. My son ordered the steak and over half of it was fat although he said what he could eat was tasty. My brother and his wife ordered the lobster plate which was the main reason we drove out to the east from Metairie. 45 min later (and after my son and I finished eating) they just decided to cxl their order. Other things to note, although plates are $20 each and the tables are skirted they serve you in Styrofoam plates and give you plastic utensils to eat with and their are no waiters. I would've expected more spending close to $60 on lunch."
1256,Riteway Soul Food,29.997637199999996,-90.06057249999999,19.0,I really like the gumbo! Sooooo good and hits the spot!!!!! The owners are very nice!!!!!!
2732,Brick & Spoon,29.925895,-90.082509,17.0,Amazing food! My friend and I shared the Verdi salad and shrimp sandwich. Get the truffle fries! Hostess was very helpful and had great suggestions. Waitress was a little slow in getting our order and the place wasn't really that busy.
1980,Nola Cookie,29.9896875,-90.0638198,19.0,Omg. Best cookies I have ever had. This is a small business but man o man they are big on flavor. The pumpkin spice is out of this world. And it is a black owned business! Winning!!!!
1972,Nadeau - Furniture with a Soul,29.9261767654,-90.082255655,19.0,"I just purchased my second item (2 1/2 years after the 1st) from Nadeau and I remember why I haven't gone back sooner.  They have some great furniture, reasonably priced, but the people who work there are totally lackadazical and have some of worst customer service skills I've ever experienced.  Working in a service oriented business, I love and appreciate good customer service.  The people who work here need training in how to treat customers if they expect repeat business."
1154,G & O Food Company,29.952931,-90.073131,17.0,"Yummy! I am happy to see a good lunch spot in the Exchange Center building.  I have visited twice and both orders get my thumbs up. Quiches are fresh made and tasty. The Salmon Blt (served on rye according to menu, but I asked for multi-grain) was absolutely delicious!  Options are fresh, healthy, and tasty."
2816,Ole Saint,29.953929,-90.0683631,16.0,"When in NOLA, you MUST come to Ole Saint!  Lindsay the bartender is aMAYzing! And she totally knows her beer! Ask her anything! Plus, she told us about this beer app for your phone that helps you rate and remember the beers you've tried. She's totally cool.  So, apart from our awesome beertender, the food is absolutely delicious! And the draught beer selection is phenomenal! I couldn't believe this place is owned by a former pro football player b/c had I known that before, I may not have gone in to the place thinking (especially with the memorabilia), ""Eh, he's just selling his name. It's probably not that great."" But how wrong I would've been b/c he did this place right! I'm definitely going back! :D"
3415,Feelings Cafe,29.963869899999995,-90.0516822,2.0,"how beautiful.    such a romantic spot, and food looks delicious.   we will be back to eat.   today we just came in for birthday drinks."
75,LA Smokehouse,29.962066999999998,-90.117703,18.0,"What an AMAZING occurrence that we ended up here after another barbecue place ran out of food!  So yeah, we started out at another spot and they were out of food when we got there. Super bummed and still in the mood for barbecue, we started wandering around Mid City and my trusty Yelp app guided me to this place. We were greeted by the super nice woman working the counter and she explained the whole process.  I decided to get the one-meat plate with ""wet"" pulled pork, grits and potato salad, I also got a medium mac and cheese, because I can. My boyfriend got the two-meat plate with brisket and pulled chicken with potato salad and fries. The food blew us both away! It was delicious from beginning to end. The pulled pork was perfect and had the perfect amount of sauce without being drenched. I could tell that if I hadn't ordered it wet it still would have been able to stand on it's own. The mac and cheese was incredible, and after the pork, was my favorite part of the meal. The stone ground grits had a different type of flavor (almost smoky) that I enjoyed and the potato salad was served cold and had that nice crunch that I like in potato salad,  We both agreed that the food was excellent, and a good deal to boot, and that we would both make the trip back out to Earhart, just to have more of this delicious food. The owner himself was bringing the food out to folks and he was really friendly and made sure that we were happy with everything. I like when the owners take the time to make sure that everything is okay. The atmosphere is casual and comfortable and the entire process was a breeze. I will definitely return to LA Smokehouse and I'll be adding it to my ""BBQ Favorites"" list for future reference."
1656,Spitfire,29.960594,-90.05962240000001,5.0,Incredibly rude management/bartender. I'm usually pretty compassionate towards service industry people but I can't really muster an excuse for this particular experience.
3518,Ulta Beauty,29.9407164727,-90.0950057233,19.5,"Don't go to the salon. I got a Nioxin blowout. A blowout gives you volume, my was flat to my head. She brushed my hair from root to tip ripping through it all. I called to let the managers know and they said there was nothing they could do and made it seem like I was making it up or that it was normal. I think there is a reason people don't know there is a salon in ulta, if they do, hopefully now they will know not to go. She also started working carelessly when her next client came. The manager said the only thing she can see wrong was that she over booked, but I shouldn't have to take the brunt of it. Don't waste your money."
1952,Cafe Prytania,29.926455199999996,-90.0921501,4.0,Great Hang.. regulars and locals YEAH! no nonsense but personable client and staff.  Great live music and affordable drinks in a FUN setting.. WATTS not to like?
118,Lucky Dogs,29.9508859,-90.0680892,5.0,"It's 4am, you're hammered, you're hungry... find one of these carts on Bourbon St. and get a loaded up dog (chili is a must)! Damn good dog! The next morning you'll thank me... or maybe not."
278,Li'l Dizzy's Cafe,29.9686422,-90.0679433,17.0,"The catfish, chicken, gumbo and mac &a cheese are all to die for. We are the lunch buffet and everything was piping hot and fresh. This place was recommended by a local in the neighborhood we are staying in and it was so worth it!"
941,Cafe Treme,29.9654586,-90.06956690000001,16.0,"Great service. Not too crowded, plus they serv sno-balls out the back window during the spring and summer. Another best kept secret in Treme."
779,Miss Smarty Pants,29.921241100000003,-90.1166569,19.0,"This is one of those shops that I can't believe I haven't reviewed, as I've stopped in here for years. They have plenty of moderately price jewelry and housewares and doodads that make great gifts...if you have the girly sorts to purchase for.  Another I like about this shop, it's not packed to the roof with stock. You can actually peruse without being overwhelmed and move without fearing that you're going to take out a shelving unit of glassware. WHEW.  The staff has always been helpful without being push and there is often free wine while you shop (BONUS). Sometimes I hit the jackpot and sometimes not.   The upstairs (ok 3 steps) back room is a separate business so be prepared to use your card twice if you want merchandise from both spaces."
2687,Merry Christmas & All That Jazz,29.9579418,-90.06147159999999,18.0,Nice shop just a block past Cafe du Monde.  They have reasonable prices for postcards compared to what you find at other stores or on Bourbon Street.  All sorts of knick knacks to look at. There are paintings and the usual souvenir stuff you'd find in most shops.
2037,Tastee Restaurant,30.004745500000002,-90.1035723,14.0,"How can anyone ever find something wrong with Tastee Donuts?!  It's McKenzies with a different name.  Shouldn't every New Orleanian be grateful that they saved McKenzies awesome recipes!?  Everything, everything, everything at Tastees is great."
2647,Poindexter’s Delicatessan,29.969390899999997,-90.0521636,18.0,"I thought I was going to have a good lunch with the turkey sandwich, I had no idea I was actually going to have lunch and be impressed with the turkey sandwich. Completely delicious. Not overly fussy or complicated but amazing flavors, textures, and clearly homemade. Will definitely get it again. Excellent!"
2362,Who Dat Coffee Cafe,29.9668381,-90.05411509999999,16.0,"With some of the best pastries in the area, this is one of those must see coffee shops. Want good cupcakes without going to a cupcake shop, this is your place.   They take credit cards, and are more polished than some of the other coffee shops I go to.   Need a mail box?  A meeting place for a group? It won't be private or formal, but groups can come chill on the front or back patio, on the couch in the back, or in the dining room up one step.   They now have a full kitchen / restaurant open a few days a week, but its never open when I am there (later in the day) I wish they still had some basic food available anytime other than bagels and pastries."
1157,Nola Crawfish King Seafood & Barbecue,30.012768800000003,-90.0506133,18.0,"What a dick. I would give less stars if I could. For someone from New Orleans he's rude, condescending, communicates very poorly and just plain didn't show up after booking him. Shaggy is not a reliable person and I would suggest getting crawfish anywhere else before this guy. Don't be duped, Shaggy lacks integrity."
406,PJ's Coffee - Gentilly,30.026429999999998,-90.05419,16.0,"Could use a makeover, a clean-up day, maybe another interior decorater but nonetheless the coffee is great. The pastries in the pastry case is often scarce but when it's not I always have to get a chocolate croissant which is amazing, it's almost like nutella in the inside when it's warmed."
3278,Verti Marte,29.962126,-90.061236,9.0,Scratching my head on the reviews for this one.  My wife and I went there to eat the great po boys.   The place looks bad.  When you walk in you see it is very cramped.  There were two people behind the register smoking and they looked like they didn't want to be there.  We went to the back and was about to order the po boys.  My wife saw a roach on the floor and said lets get out of here.  We left fast past the large signs that stated... cash only...  forget this place folks.
164,Melt,29.962102,-90.087958,18.0,"Cute interior and owner (?) gave us tour of upcoming patio/rooftop area which will be great on beautiful days like today. Cheese curds were very good and very filling. Really like that sandwiches come w salad, esp after eating too many curds! Had the onion, gruyere, tomato sandwich. Wasn't too much cheese which I liked. Needed something else...pepper jelly maybe. Would like to see more menu options added such as salads w fun cheeses. Lots of beer and wine as well as limited cocktails. Next time I will try one of the draft wines."
3411,Idle Hands Tattoo Parlour,29.932107000000002,-90.073549,18.0,"Flex is great! Finding a good tattoo artist you trust is like finding a good mechanic or doctor, that's why Flex is my guy from now on. Flex is patient, courteous, has a clean shop, and is a skilled artist. He did a half sleeve that covered up a crappy tattoo I got while in the Navy and it looks great. I plan on going back so he can cover up some of my other crappy Navy tattoos as well."
1613,Harkins,29.932405600000003,-90.073162,18.0,First time using this florist and I am beyond please. They delivered the arrangement when  they said they would and it was the most beautiful arrangement I have ever seen. Thanks so much. And I will recommend them to everyone. M Jackson
3084,Black Heritage Gallery,29.9590184,-90.0654619,3.0,Amazing shop for unique souvenirs and images if you're a history buff or print collector.
1826,The Domino,29.967519,-90.0449964,5.0,"Great little bar with wonderful drinks, chill atmosphere and a great board game selection. They have some amazing classics to games you might not of heard of. The bartender was trying to teach me a game called, ""Tiger and Goats"".  The Bywater Sour was a great cocktail! I had to stop myself cause I wanted to get another after already having 2. The Barleby was light and refreshing perfect on these hot summer days.  Highly recommend this charming neighborhood bar!"
2069,Taco Bell,29.919805,-90.01252099999999,16.0,"I always have to change the ingredients when I order to exclude the meat and dairy (vegan). Every Taco Bell that I order from is always more than happy to accommodate me. That wasn't the case at this particular Taco Bell the staff made me feel as if I was asking too much and even commented ""oh lord"" when I was trying to customize my order. Needless to say I decided to cancel my order and leave. I would understand it being a problem if there was a long line but I was literally the only customer. I shouldn't have people trying to make me feel bad for choosing to exclude meats as well as dairy from my diet. Especially when I'm spending my money on it."
2840,Johnny White's Pub & Grill,29.958866999999998,-90.0652891,15.0,"Great little bar right off Bourbon Street. Truthfully, we met one of their bartenders, Monica, at Boondock Saint next door the night before and followed her to this place where she works alternate nights. Fun little low-key place with plenty of regulars and locals."
2283,Atchafalaya Restaurant,29.921271500000003,-90.0878562,16.0,"Located in a sleepy residential neighborhood, Atchafalaya was a nice little gem. Live jazz being played in the bar area made for a wonderful soundtrack for our meal. The food was solid, the service was super friendly (albeit, a wee bit slow). See the photo of my shrimp and grits... tasty!"
1843,The Original Italian Pie,29.951425699999998,-90.0749128,15.0,I love this Italian Pie! The wings are always on point!  The pizza is actually really tasty. My only complaint is that when ordering to go they have forgotten my drinks every single time!  Other than that they are super good and in an area with 4 other pizza spots within a 2 block radius that says a lot!
1248,Soulé Cafe,29.962077,-90.08798279999999,18.0,"Soooo... it was generally bland. The vegan mac & cheese was nothing special, same with the vegan chicken nuggets and fried cauliflower. Cauliflower was super greasy. My friend said you screwed up a couple of her orders too. Sorry y'all!"
69,Vue,29.958266700000003,-90.0772682,2.5,"Visited this rooftop bar for a private party. Parking is terrible, but everyone knows that going anywhere around downtown NOLA. I also had no idea one needed a room key to go to this floor. Thank goodness the front door guy asked if we needed assistance since we looked confused. Could have more of a selection of alcoholic beverages, but... it's still new. It's also a bit off the beaten path, but the view is really nice. Comfortable seating areas with trendy furnishings. If you have a hot date or a good group to have fun with, it's a very cool place. I'm sure this will be a new hot spot. Who doesn't like a snazzy little rooftop bar? I'll definitely be back to have another great night."
1121,Blockbuster Video,29.946215000000002,-90.11319300000001,14.0,"Dear Blockbuster I used to come visit you practically every day but I am sorry I cheated and it started out as just what I thought would be a fling but it's more than that now and I can't pretend that I'm not in love. So, unfortunately until you can provide me with a deal that will make me swoon back to you permanently I will only be visiting you occasionally. I wish I could rate you higher but since your dramatic diet I sometimes, no I often can't find what I'm looking for. Your fellow companions who help me at the store treat me with kindness and for that I am grateful. Until we meet again I'll bid you good day."
919,BJ's Lounge,29.9628292,-90.0329995,5.0,Great Bar with an amazing staff and friendly patrons who are always down to chat and listen to good tunes on the juke box.
3250,TM Breads & Pastries,29.9516258196,-90.0727445117,16.0,We purchased a Togo almond croissant which was  over $4. Unfortunately when we got back to our hotel & took a bite it was completely stale. How can a bakery sell you stale goods? Those need to be thrown out. Horrible experience. Should have realized it would be bad. We walked past this cafe about 6 times whilst staying at the Roosevelt & it was always quiet. Stay away from owners who sell you stale goods!
1944,Bevi Seafood,29.9757657,-90.09874920000001,19.0,"Bevi's boiled crawfish were awesome. Just enough spice. The wait was annoying, but they were doing the best they could. Definitely will be back!"
2174,Lalosh Silver,29.959481444,-90.059899841,18.0,"I got a bracelet made here with three stones of my choosing and the gentleman did an amazing job! You can tell he takes pride in what he does and he enjoys doing what his ancestors have been for a long time. Definitely a must see, and a great chance to get something specifically made just for you!"
1695,H&M,29.9544186,-90.0645593,19.0,"It's suppose to be a flagship store although it doesnt feel like it. Housewares is way too small. So is their curvey girl section.  It's teeny.  If you're curvey don't expect too much. First floor is all abt us chics. Still though, compared to other stores it should be bigger. I'll take what I can though."
2368,Jazz Funeral,29.958960100000002,-90.0610517,18.0,"True, when it comes right down to it this is nothing more than another tacky French Quarter tourist trap that sells over priced tee-shirts (OK, I admit it - I live here and I bought one) and other assorted crap but it's by far the coolest of such shops. It has all of the required fake voodoo items that the name implies as well as a good selection of fake mardis gras beads, cheesy sex toys, coffee cups, shot glasses, etc. required of such establishments. But hey, it's fun. I take out of town visitors here and they mostly all love it. Hey, grab grandma and go!"
2848,NTB - National Tire & Battery,30.048147180100003,-89.95668768879999,14.5,"Super friendly but service is so slow. Brought my car in for a standard oil change  at 2:41 pm and they said it would only be an hour. It's now almost 5 pm and my service is still not complete. They gave updates on my vehicle every once in a while though it was always, ""We are almost done."" But then a significant amount of time would pass. They have an online appointment feature. Perhaps that's the route I should have taken."
1522,The Blind Pelican,29.937599600000006,-90.0760819,19.0,"First and last time eating here....  I held my self for a week before i wrote this review/comment. Having said that if any one out there feels compelled not to be a patron of an establishment who's owner believes that its ok to shout out derogatory comments in regards to race and ethnicity well read on ..   I visited Samuel's Blind Pelican on Oct. 13th during their happy hour. The Chard Oysters where good only complain could be the sandy crunchy taste at the end. The bartender was great..! she was very attentive. I ended up staying till the first quarter of the Monday night game.   My unfortunate encounter with the Pelican's owner happen the following thursday after visiting the neighboring restaurant. The Pelicans owner stood on the side walk 10 feet from where i was having lunch. He called the city to inquire if the restaurant (tacos and beer) had acquired the proper permits to have a TV on the front patio. He began to spew derogatory comments and racial slurs about the current owners to a buddy of his. Loud enough for all to hear. I was actually shocked and was lost for words.  He then looked at me and made a comment. I believe he thought i was an employee of the restaurant. Once he did, I couldn't help but to say something. It was awful what came out this mans mouth. He continued to shout racial comments from the steps of his restaurant to the Tacos and Beer owner. The cops where called. I was asked by the restaurant if i would stay to speak to the officers.    What makes me sick to my stomach is to know that i was also a patron of this establishment. I can not believe that there are people out there who still believe is fine to use use such derogatory comments in regards to race. He had no care of those around him. The Officers asked me if i was willing to press charges against the Pelicans owner for disturbing the peace. He was also told by officers that after that rant he could be charged for a hate crime against the neighboring restaurant for calling the city and heckling their clientele.   no one should condone the use of race or ethnicity as a shortcoming..."
384,Jazzy Pete's,29.948261199999997,-90.1307373,10.5,"A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!! Great flavorful food. Everything was exceptional. We ordered: the crawfish fries, char grilled oysters, curry shrimp, and the Boot Po Boy. Food arrived quickly and hot! The drinks were great as well. Definitely a must visit!!"
3002,So Good Jewelry,29.958503000000004,-90.066079,5.0,"I adore this place on so many levels! They pull you in with their pink decor, zebra carpet bright lights and shiny sparkly jewelry. It's the ultimate girl trap.  I love anything that glitters in the light and this place has it by the truckload: There is shiny everything from earrings and bracelets to necklaces and keychains. Some of it is big and obnoxious (in a good way) and some of it is subtle and dainty. I swear, I would show you but you really aren't allowed to take pictures here, probably because it ruins the magic.  I wanted some ""statement"" rhinestone earrings, and fortunately I was in the area, so I found myself in So Good. I found exactly what I was looking for immediately. Staff will follow you around the store, especially if you come later in the evening. Don't take it personally, I am sure they have people trying to steal all the time.  This is your one stop shop for anyone who wants their costume jewelry to make a statement and get them noticed."
840,Five Happiness Chinese Restaurant,29.964385999999998,-90.110862,17.0,Been eating here for 20 years.. Somehow the quality has went down and the prices have went up..  Hopefully one day 5 Happiness will get it's act together.  Best avoid for now until they stop producing bland chinese like but really not food.
3127,New Orleans Cooking Experience,29.940659000000004,-90.0788479,22.0,"5 stars all the way!  I can't say enough good things about this experience, and it is an experience - not a restaurant.  Here's the deal.  You are treated to an evening with a local chef  where you get to sit in the kitchen with them as they cook you a wonderful 3-4 course meal (go with Frank Brigtsen - usually Thursday evenings).  I must warn you that it is not cheap, $150 per person. But for this price you get a once in a lifetime event - in my opinion.   The evening starts early, about 5:30, at the plantation on Bayou road. Judy greets all of her guests at the door and then the fun starts. Enjoy some complimentary wine (included in the price) and relax and get to know your new dinner companions - usually a meal is for 10 people or so. Tour the plantation or simply kick back and enjoy.  Judy is a wonderful hostess and does a great job of keeping the wine flowing. ;)  Then everyone moves into the kitchen where you sit around the chef while they cook your meal for you. You have the opportunity to interact and ask questions or simply listen to their stories (Frank is a great storyteller) while chatting with your new friends.  Added bonus: Judy provides everyone copies of the recipes included in the menu so you can take notes if you'd like while the chef is preparing your meal.   Once dinner is ready you adjourn to the dining room and the feasting begins!  Definitely a special occasion venue but oh so worth the price - at least once!   I've recommended it to friends, co-workers and family over the years and I have yet to hear that anyone was disappointed in their evening.  Definitely start with one of Frank's meals though. He is a local celebrity and started his training under the famous Paul Prudhomme of K-Paul's."
2498,Turtle Bay,29.960265999999997,-90.0597512,7.0,"We arrived in New Orleans quite late at night and were excited to start trying the local cuisine. But it was 2am. Plenty of bars were open but no restaurants. We tried Coop first but its kitchen had closed. So we went a couple doors down to Turtle Bay. Their gumbo definitely hit the spot. It was very flavorful, a bit on the salty side, but went well with the huge piece of garlic bread that came with each cup of soup. Sweet potato fries came with powdered sugar. And buffalo wings were perfect! They weren't overly fried and were still tender inside. Love this place!"
3494,Nawlins Cigar and Coffee,29.9588386,-90.0637744,18.0,This place is the worst. The lady is rude and pushy not to mention she immediately started to reach for my friends purse and asked how much money she had. She also rang up the same cigar at different prices and then asked us of extra money to make up the difference for her mistake. I've heard other people say the same so my guess is it was a scam to get more money from us. Avoid!
2478,GameStop,29.926383972199996,-90.07032775879999,17.5,"Just leaving this GameStop, I went in looking for a power cord for a PlayStation pro, the people who you guys hire are extremely clueless when it comes to games and products that are in the store. It's so frustrating when you go somewhere looking for something and the one person who should know has no clue what you're talking about. No matter how detailed or precise your explanation is, they're still clueless. This is one GameStop I will not be visiting again. On top of that he was on the phone with a customer and didn't know the answer to the customers question I answered it for him but he completely ignored me and left the customer clueless as to what he/she was looking for. Please please please hire people who actually know what they're talking about."
1267,Deja Vieux Food Park,29.9293498904,-90.06785988809999,18.5,"Low key spot with can jam, giant jenga, and corn hole. Grant the bartender was awesome and his drinks were good and cheap. I look forward to putting this spot into my regular rotation"
1013,Rue De La Course,29.947341899999998,-90.12998490000001,17.0,"Best straight up coffee in town. Old, beautiful building that used to be a bank. Quiet upstairs seating with a nice view of the place & the cool old-school chandeliers. Bathrooms are a little rough - but really, not that bad, this isn't a chain. If that's the only trade off, I'll take it."
409,Nola Nica - New Orleans,29.952036699999997,-90.07033359999998,17.0,"Ordered the Nola Nica Burger and the Nachos. The burger has sweet plantains, a vinegarette slaw, queso frito and the Nola Nica secret sauce. Everything comes together and each flavor of the burger is present and stands out individually in each bite. The chefs were super nice and got the food out promptly. Awesome experience overall. Can't wait to go back!"
781,Catahoula Rooftop Bar,29.9516963,-90.073235,14.0,Stop into this hidden bar with a friend on a bike tour of Happy Hours around the city. Catahoula offers cocktails you may not find anywhere else in NOLA with its Peruvian influences. Though the cocktails are still rather expensive even during the happy hour compared to other happy hours the fact that they are not your typical sazerac makes up for it. The food menu is pretty good for happy hour with half price off appetizers. The star of the show is the upstairs rooftop bar. Very cool as you dont off see roofs used much in the hot climate of New Orleans.
211,Earthbound Trading Company,29.955925300000004,-90.0629624,18.0,We visited the store in the French Quarter on Decatur. This is a super store with many wonderful items and unusual items. The best part of my visit was the employee named Shannon. She was most helpful and very pleasant and really made our visit there memorable.
2014,Little Miss Muffin Children & Home,30.0042325,-90.10614140000001,18.0,I like this store. It's cute. I like to buy gifts here. BUT WHY OH WHY are the hours so unreasonable? Closing at 2pm on Sunday?? Seriously?
1977,Streetcar Poboys & Seafood,29.937915999999998,-90.07582640000001,18.0,"Great po boys, good service.  The roast beef debris was delicious, roast beef was perfectly tender."
2902,Phillys Cafe,29.9418183,-90.0947971,18.0,"WooHoo, best philly cheese staks I have had in New Orleans. These guys are between the McDonalds and the old Pizza Hut on Claiborne, I got carry out for the first time from there and wow it was good. They are not dripping grease like most cheese steaks and the bread is great. Many times the sub rolls on cheese staks are huge and you end up with too much bread, not the case here. WARNING, they spice their meat and it has a bit of kick. Definately give these guys a shot if you are in the area."
445,The Maison,29.9627937,-90.05800040000001,4.0,"Bad. Bad, bad, bad. This is a very bad restaurant. The music is good, the food is decent, but the management needs to decide what they actually want this place to be, because they're juggling a bar, live music, and a kitchen, and the food service is what is suffering as a result.   My wife, couple friends and I came here for her birthday, and it started poorly when we had to wait to be greeted by the hostess. You need to have someone tethered to the hostess station. It is really bad business to have people waiting for a table at a less than full restaurant. After a round of drinks we ordered and proceeded to wait nearly an hour for the food to come out of the kitchen. I'm not unsympathetic to servers, but you at least have to acknowledge to your customers when you're not living up to expectations. The band on stage made the wait a little more bearable, but the meal was subsequently rushed, as we had after dinner plans. Additionally, for the quantity and quality of the food, they're overreaching on their pricing. If they're trying to offset the cost of bringing musicians in to play, I think a better model would be to charge a cover."
867,Cat's Meow,29.958793100000005,-90.0656443,5.0,We got the urge to sing during my bachelorette trip so was pointed to Cat's Meow.  We put our names in on the super long list of names and patiently drank and waited.  It wouldn't have taken so long if the MC dude didn't sing EVERY OTHER SONG.  Why oh why would you do that? I understand you want to keep the crowd pumped up but not every other song.  We waited over and hour and were no where close to being called so left.
3315,Circle Bar,29.9428822539,-90.0722989452,4.0,"Ooh, what a charming sweaty dive bar this is. good drinks, and a long night full of instant new best friends as I recall."
2616,Vegan Chef NOLA,29.939396999999996,-90.079121,10.0,Listen this place is sooo good! I just came from there! NEVER MADE A REVIEW BUT I HAD TO LET THE PEOPLE KNOW! Matter fact Im gonna come back later this week and get so more food! I didn't take pictures but I will next time. Bread pudding and mac and cheese good! They were very nice and my plate was full and so is my belly! See ya'll again soon!
177,Landry's Seafood House,29.9565245,-90.06274,18.0,Very good. Fast seating. Service was very good but it took awhile for our food to come out. Red beans and rice and crab cakes were amazing.
2058,Koreole,29.968676348600003,-90.04786108649999,21.0,I ordered the bibimbowl and the shrimp egg roll. They were both delicious. The menu is limited but both dishes had a unique taste!
1846,Sneaky Pickle,29.964899900000002,-90.0429541,18.0,"Delicious, Good prices, & light on the tummy! I had their one non-vegetarian meal item of the day, and it was incredible!"
422,Haute Women's Boutique,29.946415500000004,-90.06927579999999,16.0,"They are back in business after being closed periodically after Harvey.   Great boutique with wonderful customer service!  Great t-shirts, blouses, jewelry, shoes, candles, and all things ""boutique""."

1990,Domenica,29.953878999999997,-90.07162470450001,17.0,"It pains me to write this review. Such a waste of excellent ingredients. So here it goes and I hope someone in management reads it.   We ordered an octopus carpaccio and shaved brussel sprout salad to start followed by a pizza and crab linguini. The quality of the ingredients, and the recipes was superb. As was the cooking other than the linguini (just plain undercooked, I'm Italian, I was a cook, I don't need any lessons on al dente). Other than one issue, the food was not even warm when delivered to the table.   Now pacing. Within minutes of giving the order, both starters came. Since so far our experience with NOLA is you get seriously rushed, we told the waiter we had plenty of time and slow things down. He replied no problem. Before we finished the appetizers someone from the kitchen delivered our 2 entrees. There was no room on the table for those let alone plates to eat the entrees on. Nor were any delivered. Nor was any serving wear delivered as we were sharing. Just plop the entrees down across the table from were we were sitting and leave. Viola, that's you fine dining experience. We rushed through the remainder of the appetizers, made our own space in the table, asked for clean plates and were introduced to the fact both the linguini and the pizza were stone cold. But the plates were warm, yes, odd. I could go on about the food prep as I was a cook but I'm letting it pass.   Excellent ingredients totally wasted. We ate some, paid, left. Yes we made a mistake, we should have sent it all back and simply left."
1,Copper Vine,29.9506467229,-90.0744274301,17.0,"The service is awesome...staff is very friendly and knowledgeable.  Go check it out! Tried the deviled eggs...Devine! The fig and goat cheese, serrano and margherita flatbreads were delicious as well."
3342,Black Star Books & Caffe,29.9474896,-90.0481408,17.0,"Their Sunday vegan brunch is amazing! A lot of vegan spots rely on meat substitues, but not here. Everything is fresh and REAL and so flavorful! The ambiance is great too. I also love the back area where they have handcrafted jewelry, body care, clothing, and other items from local Black artists."
3347,St Vincent Supermarket,29.9271164,-90.07838149999999,16.0,"Awesome little neighborhood corner store. Great place to get off the beaten path of Magazine. The guys working there were really friendly. In true New Orleans fashion, I got a shrimp po boy, bag of Zapp's, and a Barq's -- and it was all delicious. I prefer the this place over the shop up the street at Magazine.   Pro tips: The picture on Yelp of the blue menu is still accurate. There's also no seating inside -- on a nice day I would take it to-go and eat at Sophie Wright Park."
2026,Faubourg Bistro,29.9411123935,-90.1285415143,2.0,Great atmosphere! Food was good especially the Mac and cheese balls. Prices are kind of high but overall good food.

Arron"
2188,Nirvana Indian Cuisine,29.9207688,-90.1005804,16.0,"My friends and I have only ever been here for the lunch buffet, but man, the food is so good. It's a great opportunity for me to try lots of new Indian dishes for a relatively low cost ($9.99 buffet!). The chicken and potato saags were great today and I can never get enough naan. Yum!"
305,Birds Nest Cafe,30.023287,-90.0910627,19.0,"The Birds Nest is EVERYTHING!!! So New Orleans featuring local coffee and snacks! They serve amazing French Truck iced coffee and this king cake season they have Dong Phuong Vietnamese king cakes!!!!!! If you haven't had them I can not recommend it enough! Also, the morning cheese grits are a great start to any day!! DONT MISS OUT ON THIS PLACE I PROMISE ITS A GEM"
1090,The Ground Floor,29.954488479200002,-90.06646641420001,18.0,What a cute shop! They'll even deliver if you take a photo of the item and email it in! I love the trinkets! Great gifts for all occasions.
308,Empanola,29.9244627,-90.08579920000001,19.0,"Empanadas were amazing! Beef and shrimp and cheese were my favorites. The guava king cake is also great. The filling is fresh and almost tart. The woman at the front counter was a bit rude when their card reader was not working, acting as if it was our fault. Hopefully she was just having one of those days, and this is not a regular thing, so I'll keep all of the stars. Overall, great little spot in the area. Get the sauces to dip!!!!"
2660,Surrey's La Playa Juiceteria,29.942025800000003,-90.0750749,16.0,"I was very disappointed with my experience here.  When I arrived I was told there was a 40 minute wait.  I asked the host if there was anything gluten free, such as gluten free bread or muffins. He went inside to ask and came back telling me there were indeed such items. After waiting the 40 minutes and being seated, I did not see anything gluten free on the menu. I asked the server and she said there was ONE gluten free item on the entire menu. It was some sort of egg dish. There was no gluten free bread to be found anywhere. I was not impressed with the quality of food. I will not be returning here."
2019,The Buffet at Harrah's New Orleans,29.949546100000003,-90.06449509999999,16.0,"Came here just to tryout the buffet like I normally do when I visit a casino. It says a lot about the quality service of the casino. While entering the casino it seemed very strange that the casino was pretty calm. I didn't hear people cheering or celebrating their wins, I guess not many people were winning. THE CASINO WAS EXTREMELY COLD, I wanted leave but I was to hungry so I stayed to eat at the buffet. THE BUFFET IS ABOUT 21 DOLLARS PER PERSON. THE MAJORITY OF THE FOOD WAS FRYED AND IT SEEM LIKE EVERY FOOD I TRIED WAS REALLY SALTY. THEIR SWEETS were ok, the cheesecake was pretty good. IN CONCLUSION I WAS NOT IMPRESSED with the food or the casino it self. Does not live up to hype! THUMBS DOWN!!!"
2124,Vive!,29.956173699999997,-90.0671769,4.0,"If you're in the FQ and feeling fancy and not traditional (which is a problem for me since mostly it's fancy & traditional) then Vive is the place to get a cocktail. It is really pretty.  And their fancy drink menu is really tasty & fun.    I attended an event over the summer and had something with champagne (freshly opened split bottle) and violetta.  It was pretty & super yummy to the point of dangerous.  The bartenders held their own against the overpacked house my group brought in for the evening and were really good natured about the insanity.  The patio & pool are very tempting even with the heat (or cold right now).  At the Yelp event here, I chatted up some fake Canadians and they said the rooms in the accompanying hotel was really nice.  Plus it's the sort of place where you can meet fake Canadians...but, of course, I needed Canadian Jennifer to tell me they were fake.  Well, not really since even I could tell they had the wrong accents."
2987,The Good Bar Nola,29.961099600000004,-90.05838349999999,21.0,"This review is not to bad mouth this place. I honestly want to see them do better. I've come to try this bar out twice. The first time service was so slow we decided to leave. We were told to sit anywhere so we sat outside. Nobody ever came to acknowledge us and by the time someone did come about 20 minutes later we didn't want to stay. So Saturday we decided to give this place a shot again. Service is still slow. I'm not sure why the bartender was supposed to also be our server instead of focusing on the bar. There were like two other servers and a hookah girl there. Also saw maybe a manager, so I'm not sure why nobody was working their appropriate sections. And I don't think they have table numbers because the servers were confused where orders were going. But back to my experience. The wait was getting so bad that someone else decided to take care of us. I think she saw the aggravation in our faces. She took our drink order and of course that took a while. We also ordered hookah. They were out of one of the flavors we wanted. The hookah took FOREVER to come out. Finally it came out. The hookah burned so fast it was crazy how fast it was burning out. We saw someone else send their hookah back and leave. Also, there was a $5 charge to add ice to the hookah and if I'm not mistaken there's also a charge for them to change your coal. It was all interesting. The best thing about this place was the fries and music. Again, I want to see them step up in the service and hookah area. This place has potential but some things need some tweaking."

2337,Bella Umbrella,29.9303261,-90.0752003,19.0,"I have long been in awe of every beautiful, well made piece in here. Umbrellas you want, there is absolutely no other place to go. But my review doesn't involve a purchase at all. Went in seeking advice on some pieces I am working on. I was 1st greeted by a very friendly & accommodating employee who put me in contact with the owner. Returned to chat with the owner, not only had every question answered, had a lovely chat where I picked up many tips. Was never pressured to buy anything, just got to experience a wonderful example of another reason why Bell Umbrella is so fantastic."

Dropping in will definitely be a weekly occurrence from now om.   I ordered the garlicky broccoli florets, mac & cheese, and lobster bisque. I got to to sample a chocolate cookie while waiting for my to go order, and they threw in a crab cake for me to sample with my meal at home! Everything was fresh, cooked from scratch, and well seasoned. The mac & cheese was as good as my favorite one at Cochon Butcher and $2 less expensive. I loved it all but I think the crab cake was my favorite. But I know I will be craving that cookie very soon. I don't know, maybe the bisque was my favorite. There are so many other things I want to try too like the wraps and the many other veggie sides.  I must mention the service. The gentleman taking my order was so kind and friendly; turned my mood from tired and grumpy to smiling from ear to ear. That means everything to me!"
454,Chinese Inn,29.9748913,-90.0488266,21.0,"I feel bad because I REALLY use to love this spot! So the area is the cut off between where the hood meets the hipster part of St. Claude area. You order from a cage window, which can seem a little suspect in the past to me but the food was always so fresh and delicous you could over look that you life may be in danger to get a boneless chicken plate. But this last visit all of that changed, everything was the same for the most part ordering from a cage and STILL cash only. The food was hot, but had such a strange taste to it. The chicken had a taste of like gas, like the gas stove type of taste. the rice was okay but the pork and beef in it was SO salty. I couldnt even chew it I was getting a head ache. All in all I felt like I wasted 8 bucks on a plate I couldnt enjoy or even eat for that matter. I believe that is my last time going there."
3525,Two Sisters Kitchen,29.9611327,-90.0776051,18.0,"Had the $30 brunch it was great! Omelette to order, large breakfast buffet, desserts, fruits, peel em' shrimp, delicious grits, étouffée, I could go on and on. I definitely are my money's worth. Live music too. Great breakfast spot to satisfy your hangover needs."

Great colors and pleasant clean environment. I was gonna give is 4 due to the blonde she beast working the front, but why hurt the shop cus they have a miserable twot working up front. Hopefully they'll put her out with the trash. So bad I nearly left to go to Electric Lady, but Cameron stepped up and saved the day. I will definitely be back my next NOLA visit."
2237,Liborio's Cuban Restaurant,29.950047499999997,-90.06813079999999,17.0,"I stopped by here twice for a mojito on my trip to NOLA.  The mojito was handmade in the slow way that somehow makes it taste better.  The girl behind the bar muddled the crap out of the mint leaves with (I think) Country Time Lemonade Mix.  This actually produced a fantastic drink.  Maybe the mint coulda been more intact, but I'm not complaining."
531,The Chloe,29.927073800000002,-90.0993069,19.0,"DIdn't live up to the hype (which I wasn't aware of until my friend told me). Seated temporarily at a table on gravel just steps from the sidewalk and the maitre'd podium. When you can smell car exhaust from your table, that's a bad sign for fine dining. The waitress took our drink order only after we flagged her down after she took the drink order of the table next to us. When we were moved inside we were seated in a sort of strange hallway off to the side from the dining rooms, decorated with what looked like trellises from Home Depot. It was empty except for me and my companion. The creepy quiet contrasted with other rooms we could see from where we sat, in which money had been spent on decor. Our area seemed like the place where the help was supposed to eat. Maybe you have to know someone."

2505,The Old No 77 Hotel and Chandlery,29.947904700000002,-90.0675054,15.0,"I'm a current resident in this hotel and this is my experience, all less than 24 hrs. I showed up at 10:30pm and the front door was locked because they lock it between the hours of 11pm-6am...I rang the doorbell and went to the front desk where I wasn't greeted. I then introduced myself and said I had a reservation, started the check in process then the girl at the front desk took a phone call, then another phone call....11:10 I check in and head to my room, which was smaller than described the floors dirty and a little dusty, not too bad but it doesn't look like they clean as well as other hotels. I take a shower in the morning and yes the rain shower head though looks fancy isn't the greatest when the shower doesn't close so water does get everywhere. I have a street view which is really loud but didn't effect my sleep, but I'm not a light sleeper. My biggest issue was when I was randomly walking through the Nola streets having a good time and decided to check where a free atm was and looked at my account and saw that they charged me again for a room that I prepaid for, I went back to the hotel asked them to fix it and also just randomly checked hotel prices and exact same room for more than half the price. So let me get you the quick details: 1. I was not greeted when I entered and took 30+ mins to check in.  2. The room wasn't as big as described(they explained to another resident that is European style so it is the same size just looks smaller...) 3. They double charged me (when i first made the reservation i thought I would actually be charged then, but i wasn't and just randomly without warning they did 2 separate transactions so if you're not prepared for that i don't know what to tell you!) 4. They won't prove match their own rates after you check in. If i wouldn't have checked they would have prove matched my last day because you need 72hrs to do it, so for a Sunday I'm paying $348 bit if you checked in right now you'd pay 135... I have this place a two when I started writing based off ambiance because even though it's small, the exposed brick and crappy hardwood floors do lol nice...that's it, customer service isn't the greatest, fare practices are out the window and street noise is loud. But if you want to stay here after all that, well I warned you. I checked in Thursday night at 11:10pm it's 4:05pm Friday and I'm writing this review...Oh housekeeping starts around 9am so be prepared for the knocks on the door but they're cool!  My honest recommendation if you want to stay here: don't book too early, they have good rates when you get closer to your date but also certain days might be booked already, so it's hard to accomplish if you're a planner."
1776,Uptown Angler,29.945863,-90.070531,20.0,"My favorite fly shop in the city. It might be the only fly shop in the city but that's just fine with me. They have an excellent selection of rods, reels, lines, and flys all at reasonable prices. While most of there merchandise is geared towards saltwater fishing (8 weight and up), you won't have trouble finding 4-6 weight equipment. Not too many smaller flies but they do carry a few small poppers in multiple colors. I've caught monster bluegill in city park on a light blue popper I bought here. These guys are just great. If you're a fly fisherman this is a must visit shop."
3072,A Girl Is A Gun,29.9222115,-90.12200209999999,19.0,"We've driven past this store so many times, and were intrigued, but it was usually at night when it was closed. So yesterday, on a rare afternoon off, my partner and I decided to stop by. We were greeted as soon as we entered, and told to just ask if we needed anything. Being a plus size gal, I could only admire the beautifully merchandised clothing. But, there was plently to catch my eye. I loved their fun, funky, and reasonably priced jewelry. I bought a great gun necklace. I noticed that the store had an unusual, intoxicating aroma, and asked the lovely gal working, (the owner?), about it. She told me that it was the store's own scent, which she designed. I bought some, and adore it! We didn't have much time, so I only bought two things, but would love to go back for a cool Lux de Ville bag, more jewelry, or one of those great pagoda style umbrellas. Gorgeous store, and the way nice gal working with us invited us back, and even complimented our jewelry and glasses. We will be heading back, and I highly recommend this cool gem of a store."
3286,Bar Food at Cosimo's Bar,29.963988,-90.06389279999999,4.0,Neighborhood bar that doesn't look like much from the outside but was pleasant and relaxing. Brendan the bartender was personable and friendly. Nick made us very tasty grilled chicken burgers. The fries were  just the way I like them- thin and crispy. Very good lunch for a reasonable price.
2379,Bywater American Bistro,29.962543,-90.047937,3.0,Simply fantastic. What a nice surprise I had with my experience here with a visiting friend. We actually intended to eat at another location but that restaurant was booked. The bistro was also booked but had two seats at the bar. I am so glad we chose to eat there. My friend and I both had fish. We each had a different type of fish. The service was very friendly and prompt. Most of all the dinner was spectacularly prepared and delicious. I live in the Bywater and I am so glad this great restaurant is located so close to me. I am imagine I will be a regular here.
2429,Voodoo Blues,29.958693199999995,-90.0653968,16.0,"Souvenir shops on Bourbon Street are a dime a dozen.  Why I never found the need to buy trinkets to spark memories, many do and this place is as good as the next.  Pricey, but some unique stuff."

The staff were friendly and helpful both on the floor and at the registers. Best of all the prices are great."
2287,The Yard,29.962044,-90.057491,3.0,"This place is perfect! Sitting in the courtyard, enjoyed some great eats and amazing cocktails. Mia, our server, has made our visit to NOLA perfect!

1928,ICHI Japanese Ramen House,29.9644543032,-90.0590793416,16.0,"Tonight was my first time being in this building since last year (it was previously Sukho Thai).  I went in with two of my friends for a late dinner, and did not expect to receive such great service!  We were the only table in there at the time and he asked if we wanted to play music, so I requested Pantera and our server had no problem doing so.  When I ordered my dish, I asked for a vegan ramen bowl and he told me his go-to order for vegans and it was SO DELICIOUS!  He was really nice, and I wish I could remember his name so I can give credit where it's due!  I had a great time there and I will definitely return!  You can never go wrong with metal music and delicious ramen."
1289,QT Pie Boutique,29.956095,-90.0696037,18.5,Great store with a great selection. The people there are very helpful as well. We will check this out on every NOLA trip for sure.
2075,Urban Roots Garden Center,29.922154,-90.074574,19.0,"I cannot believe that I haven't reviewed Urban Roots yet.  I love Urban Roots!  I always find something wonderful to add to my poolside gardens.  At this point I stop by every once in a while to purchase little things for filling in or replacing items that have either burned in the summer heat or froze.    Here is a typical trip for me: first I always hit the herbs section for a little looky-look.  I like collecting new varieties of herbs I don't have yet, for example I currently have several types of mint growing just about everywhere (lavender mint, orange mint, variegated mint, chocolate mint).  Mint is wonderful here because it will grow dense in a pot, it will hang over a planter beautiful, and it will just grow legs and stretch itself all over your flower beds.  When you walk by if you just run your hand through it, you will have the scent everywhere.  I also have a beautiful variegated basil that I love and lemon grass that the doggies love to chew on.  The price is great on herbs (under $2 each, and I have gotten a lot of millage out of all of my selections.  This spring I decided to plant a flower bed that was dedicated to butterflies.  I purchased some pintas and some blood flowers.  For a while I thought my garden was unsuccessful.  Some of the pintas died from heat (they would normally be fine, but these are planted by the pool and the radiant heat over there is intense, typically I try to keep the umbrella open so my flowers don't get burned, but my neighbor is an asshole and always puts the umbrella down so death to my plants) I digress... anyway a couple of weeks ago I come out and all of the leaves and flowers on the blood flowers were eaten, but then I noticed a chrysalis and then several more!  SUCCESS now I have monarch butterflies everywhere.  Yesterday I stopped by and purchased a few snap dragons to put some color around and a new rosemary for the giant one that mysteriously died this summer.  I also said hello to a chicken that was wandering around.  I can't comment on the helpfulness of the staff because I never feel like I need help, but they always offer which can only mean good things."

3301,The Bulldog,29.923360600000002,-90.0873256,6.0,"This is one of those places you need to stop by after dinner in the area - especially on Wednesdays when beers are $5 and you can take home the unique glasses. The outdoor patio area is so great, but get there early because it gets super packed."
1731,New Orleans School of Cooking,29.955359700000002,-90.0649145,18.0,"I was hesitant at first about taking the cooking class, but thank goodness I did. Came here last summer with my boyfriend and we did a cooking class with Chief Belton. Honestly chief Belton will be reason why I would go back and take some more cooking classes. He is funny, talented and just great! Chief Belton knew how to make everyone feel comfortable and just overall make the experience enjoyable. And OMG the food was delicious!!! We learned how to make crawfish etouffee and it was creamy and it's was so flavorful and tasty. I personally am not a fan of seafood and was shocked at how much I loved the dish. And because of it crawfish is now one of my favorite food. The praline was savory and just melts in your mouth. Ugh what I would do to just go back!! I highly recommend everyone to come here and take a cooking class, regardless of your age because no matter who you are, you'll fit right in! And if I ever find myself in NOLA (which I know I will) I definitely will be back for another class."

344,Meson 923,29.9424525,-90.06582809999999,20.0,"This resturant is beautiful and the food is amazing! The house bread is so yummy, as well as the house sangria. The atmosphere is very swanky with well dressed good looking people at every table. My only complaint  is that we sat for 15- 20 mins without a wine list, menu, and water when we were seated.  For the price, I expect better service. I will try it again."

2034,Coterie Restaurant & Oyster Bar,29.95277,-90.066443,17.0,"We really enjoyed our meal here, and the service was excellent. My husband had the blackened alligator as an app and I had the crab and corn bisque - both great. Highly recommend getting blackened instead of fried... unless you just don't like blackened seasoning.  I had the shrimp po' boy and he had the red fish for our mains. I should have ordered something a little more specialized - save the po' boy for a more basic place! They do a great job with flavoring and there's a lot of great options on the menu. Worth a visit!"

Not to mention the food is exceptional, kudos to the chef..  The Turkey bugers are my fav which come loaded on a sweet bun with a serving of robust fries to enjoy!  The lemon drop Martini's are commendable!  Nice Happy Hour spot with an upstairs for clubbing.  The brunch is between 1p and 3p and  Soul in the City is coming on friday nights!

The lunch buffet was a great deal with a great selection and the food was very good. After leaving our room to checkout we decided to stop here and eat one more time before leaving NO, parked our luggage at the hostess station.

I came for Sunday brunch after seeing the crazy line outside of Refuel cafe and was not disappointed. Best plantains I've ever had in my life. The chicken flautas were out of this world and the tortilla that my breakfast burrito came in was phenomenal and authentic. The papusas were great too! Service was great. I'll definitely be back again."

Nothing pisses me off more than waiting when making an appointment. I showed up 10 minutes early for my 2 PM appointment to relax and cool off only to find the front door propped open in 93 degree heat! Anyway, after checking in and waiting 20 minutes past 2 PM I had enough. I had to go back to reception to make sure they would not charge my card as a no show. Unfortunately for Belladonna I will not be returning or sending them any business.   Regards,  JGD"

So many cool arts and crafts! I did all of my Christmas shopping there! Also, it feels good knowing that you are helping LOCAL artist and businesses. At a time when the economy isn't so great, its so important that we support our local talent. I cant say enough good things about this event. I go every month and I always see something different.

I called her hotel's concierge desk (the Le Meridien Hotel) and they recommended calling nearby florist Flora Savage, and I am so very happy that I did!  I called and spoke with Monet; she was very helpful and pleasant.  I told her my best friend's favorite flowers and that I was hoping to not exceed $55 for the arrangement and delivery to her hotel. Monet made it happen!  What was even more wonderful was that the arrangement was delivered the same day, just in time for my best friend to arrive, check-in, and find her beautiful arrangement waiting for her in her room.  Both my best friend and I are very pleased with the beautiful arrangement and the friendly and professional service of Flora Savage. Definitely recommend them! Thank you to Monet and Flora Savage for the beautifully creative floral arrangement!"

We had an 1.5 hour wait, ended up being just under that but believe me, we were glad we waited.  Began with an order of mussels and one of the cannelloni appetizers (delish!) as well as plenty of fresh garlic bread to go 'round.  Everyone at the table opted for their entre with the Ocean Sauce -- most agreed grouper was the best choice for fish and my brother Loved the veal.   I will be back next time I visit New Orleans!

I think I would call them ""happy"" clothes: a lot of skirts, dresses and tops in a lot of bright colors. I was only able to quickly stop in here today, but I will definitely be back. Lucy Rose will definitely make a nice addition to Magazine St."
1698,Kirkland's,29.960390000000004,-90.18715,19.0,"Kirklands has by far the WORST customer service I have ever had the pleasure of dealing with. I ordered a mirror online, waited an entire month, went to the store and pick it up, and it was broken. The lady whom i dealt with was RACIST and extremely rude. I asked her not to issue me a refund and instead just send another mirror. She made it seem as tho they would replace my mirror, but I later found out that she issued a refund behind my back. Since she did that, they could not send another mirror. I have spoken to just about everyone in my regional Kirklands, from district manager, to customer service, to store manager. None of them have sought reparations in order to make the buyer (me) whole again for the lady at the store's mistake. I was only offered a 30% discount. I didn't think that racism had a price, but apparently at Kirklands, its 30% off a $100 mirror."
575,Orleans Grapevine Wine Bar & Bistro,29.958612100000003,-90.0649145,3.0,"Came here with a friend. We ordered the crawfish bruschetta, the hibiscus drink, a dirty martini, the flounder and a steak. All of it was wonderful. We took advantage of the nice weather and sat out on the patio. It was lovely with their little heat lamps. Our waiter was great too. It was a $110 for the two of us with all of that but it was worth it."
439,Alex's Bikes,29.9639468,-90.05502709999999,17.5,"Just like Yelp says, Alex's Bikes are as good as it gets.  We rented 6 bikes from Alex for a couple of days at a time over the course of a week.  The bikes were in good condition and he fitted them for everyone in the party.  His prices were competitive and he took time to talk to us about what we wanted to do and where we wanted to go.   His suggestions were spot on.  Best of all, Alex is a super nice guy and you know he's going to take care of you.  He really helped us out on our last day in town.  We stumbled in as tourists looking for a bike rental and left as friends.  I'll be renting from Alex the next time we're in town and I would heartily recommend Alex, his shop and his bikes to anyone looking for a bike rental!"
2581,Press Street Station,29.9638408464,-90.0485634059,17.0,"I had the Margee, I misread it as garlic roasted beef, my own fault. I was pleasantly surprised how good the garlic roasted beet was. I don't think this can be eaten as sandwich, I treated like and open faced salad sandwich.  The beet was cooked just right still refreshing and homemade pickled peppers and pickles were a nice change. I give this a rating of indulge monthly."
2258,Nonna Mia Cafe & Pizzeria,29.9802825,-90.0840396,16.0,"This place was ok, the service wasn't good at all, we had to wait a while to get orders for drinks and for our food and the place wasn't even full. We almost walked out, the people that sat down after us did.  The food was ok nothing that stands out in my memory, it's been a few months since we went.                I do remember wanting to try some tea with some find of ice mint gelato our something like that. The waiter said that they ran out and couldn't make it for me. About 10 minutes later another waiter makes it for another customer, that pissed me off, i almost walked out but decided to give the waiter a hard time about it so i questioned him why he told me they were out and couldn't make it for me when the other waiter made it for some one else. He didn't apologize or anything he just went and made one, we got our food right after. We ate and got out of dodge we won't be back there again."
1660,Black Swan Food Experience Pop-Up,29.9595769,-90.0770127,15.0,"Black Swan is now located inside Roux Carre.  Self described as ""Creole Thai Caribbean contemporary soul food""; their menu is unique and everything sounds delicious!   I got the The No Um Bow (braised collard greens, coconut jasmine rice and Caribbean jerk chicken).  Price is right $12 for entree portion.   I know Jerk Seasoning can be a bit on the salty side. The chicken was a bit salty, not overwhelming but more than I'd like.   The coconut rice was topped with a nice coconut cream which added a more prominent coconut flavor and creaminess which I loved. The collards were good but slightly too sour (vinegar), I ended up not eating them all.   Over all I love Black Swan and can't wait to go back!"
2693,C'est la Vie Bistro,29.920728999999998,-90.09931999999999,17.0,"Went here with a group last night. I was pleased. Very nice decor and the wait staff was friendly and attentive. we started with soup, french onion for me and chicken vegetable for him. They were both fine, but not outstanding. I ordered the mussels with a blue cheese cream sauce, and my boyfriend had the casolette (which was on special) Mine was over the top good...a new and decadant twist on regular steamed mussles with white wine. And the portion was so large I have at least another meal or two in a to go box in my fridge. My boyfriend liked his cassolette (baked white beans with saussage and chicken in a rich tomato sauce) but was not in love with it. The BYOB idea is nice since it does save $ and let you tote in your favorite wine. I'm sure I will go again."
3443,Liberty's Kitchen,29.967193100000003,-90.0848478,16.0,"So I brought my wife's car to Santos Automotive to get an oil change. On a side note, if you're looking for a great mechanic, choose Santos. It's about the only mechanic shop I trust. They do great work at a reasonable/fair price.  WHAT WORKED? This was my first visit to Liberty's. As many times as I've been to the Whole Foods next door or the mechanic, I had never set foot in the place. I had wanted to support their work like Cafe Reconcile and Cafe Hope and other organizations.   So I ordered the Liberty's Breakfast, which consisted of two eggs my way (I'm partial to scrambled), two slices of bacon, toast and my choice of grits (cheesy or sans cheese), potato hash or fruit. I chose the cheesy grits. Everything was delicious. The eggs were fluffy and seasoned, the grits were hot and, well, cheesy. The cheese was thoroughly incorporated into the grits, not just shredded cheese thrown on top. I really appreciated that. The grits were creamy and only needed a sprinkling of salt and pepper. The bacon had a really good flavor and was crispy and chewy. The toast, however, took me by surprise. I normally write toast off, but this toast was really good. It was chewy with a nice bite and had a good flavor. It paired well with the butter and grape and strawberry jelly. I don't know what kind of bread it was, but there were little pieces of oat flakes on the crust.  I ordered an Arnold Palmer, but it's execution didn't meet expectations. It wasn't bad by any means, just different. They used black tea, but I'm probably used to some plain, run of the mill tea in my Arnold Palmers.  The place is really cute and looks like it would be a cool place to hangout, something akin to Starbucks or most other cafes. It has ample seating inside with an accompanying patio.   The service was great. My server Shantrell (""Trell"") appeared to be a little annoyed when I first arrived, but she soon warmed up to me and was professional and sweet in the end. She was knowledgeable about the menu. They accept Apple Pay, which is always a plus, but the feature wasn't working that day.   I saw an offer for a free pastry if I checked in and I took advantage of that, of course. Like, yeah!! The pastries that day consisted of a really big blueberry muffin, croissant, lemon ginger bread, zucchini bread and perhaps a couple other items. It was a nice selection. The zucchini bread, which I'm told is gluten free, not that it matters because I can consume gluten and non-gluten and everything else just fine, had the texture of banana bread. It was ok, but there was some grittiness when I swallowed. Not sure what that was all about.   I decided to make a pit stop before I left and noticed the bathroom was pretty clean. Always a good sign. I also noted that while it was quiet around 10:00, it was quite bustling by the time I left.   WHAT DIDN'T WORK? I'll definitely be back."
3441,Tamarind - The Hotel Modern New Orleans,29.943719,-90.07188599999999,2.0,"This was our second visit to Tamarind and what a huge disappointment! Will never go back. As soon as we walked in the door, the hostess immediately asks us if we will be using a ""living social"" coupon and if so she could not give us a separate menu of specials. We could only have the regular menu. Apparently everyone at the restaurant was using Living Social coupons that evening. The bread which was a doughy whole grain roll arrived before our glasses of wine. It seem like a very long time before we received our wine.  We decided to only order appetizers since none of the entrees appealed to us.  The lamb crepe was good but was much better when we came in March. The spring rolls were fried in stale old oil and had a rancid odor.  The summer rolls were bland and barely edible. The tuna tartare was the only appetizer that was palatable. The duck confit is served on a spongy steamed bun that is sticky and weird. The service was fair. We had a very green waitress that did not know much about the menu. We were frequently served a food item before we had utensils to eat with.  Dessert was Tamarind's saving grace.  Their ice creams are a creative blend of flavors. We were never offered coffee with our desserts. And to top it all off, our check arrived before we had finished our dessert. Overall, it was a horrible experience!  Such a disappointment from Chef Dominique!"
3061,Holiday Inn New Orleans-Downtown Superdome,29.952996000000002,-90.074968,14.0,". My room was large, very nice, and very clean. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Best of all the bed was very comfortable and they gave you choices on the firmness of your pillow. Wifi worked perfectly and am very happy.  Wasn't very impressed by the room service food coming from the restaurant in the lobby though but that is a different review."
1108,Brothers III Lounge,29.920412100000004,-90.10332659999999,6.0,"A solid dive bar open late with cheap beers and friendly folks. $2 high life. Eclectic crowd that was a bit older than Maes down the road. A genuine dive and not one of those bars built to be dives.  Everyone mentions the low ceilings, but they didn't even phase me. I suppose I'm short! Cash only. No game shows."
554,The Habitat ReStore,29.987950800000004,-90.0593503,18.0,"Part of the growing number of salvage building supply stores in the city.  While I've found that the ReStore has more furniture and appliances than the Green Project carries, there is a huge overlap in the other stuff they sell: doors, windows, hardware, and architectural details. They also have a small area filled with used books.  Toward the back, there is a conveyor belt system that goes to the second floor of the warehouse. Doesn't look like they use it, but its darn cool to stare at, which is exactly what I did.  All proceeds from the store benefit the local chapter of Habitat for Humanity, so stock up and feel good about it!"
984,Carnival Triumph,29.94080908,-90.0606333464,15.0,"First time on a cruise and it was horrible. They said it would be the vacation of a life time but it was far from. The cruise line is not baby friendly, my 11 month old had to pay the same fair as an adult, day care hours are restricted for kids under 2. We were denied the right to buy the alcohol drink package, because they said everyone in our group would have to pay the alcohol pass including the baby. The rooms are out dated. The food taste like cafeteria food. Purchases on the cruise are suppose to be tax free, but they taxed a purchase that I made. Guess service lines are extremely long, except to wait at least 45 mins before you can get help. Every thing is over priced and they are always trying to sell you something all the time. You have to pay for sodas. After 10pm you have to pay for daycare. The employees are over worked, so they walk around like zombies. The employees are not good at problem solving. There's a communication barrier, because 95% of the employees speak  broken English."
1016,Cutter's,29.9651581,-90.0514392,7.0,"This is a really nice bar with super friendly people.  We stopped in here after hanging out at Mimi's for a while. The bartender couldn't have been friendlier and the patrons were happy to chat. It's obviously a neighborhood bar full of regulars, but everyone was nice and inclusive.  The atmosphere is pretty dark and murky- it seems like a good place to go if you want to get lost for a few hours."
1348,Friend & Company Fine Jewelers,29.9423546,-90.1295963,18.5,In the years to come whenever I want an original piece of jewelry for my friends to be jealous of I will always go to Friend & Co. Ken did my engagement ring and I am still in love with my ring as much as I was the day my fiance proposed. I chose quality over size and my diamonds light up a room! I get a lot of compliments on my ring and I can't thank Ken and his team enough!
2091,Mat & Naddie's Restaurant,29.949077799999998,-90.13537640000001,2.0,"Five stars. I've been here twice, most recently last night. Love love love the neighborhood atmosphere of the dinning room. The Shrimp and Crawfish Croquettes are a can't miss appetizer and the fried oyster salad is very reliable, too. Frying oysters is pretty difficult, but they do it just right. The Filet Mignon has also been very good when I've had it. A very thick cut and cooked precisely as I've ordered it. Can't complain about the service, either. The only MINOR thing I can think of is the possibility of a loud dining room. If the place is packed or if there is a rowdy table the intimacy can be zapped out of the room pretty fast. Still, five stars."
954,Louisiana Children's Museum,29.989858014299998,-90.0939811056,18.0,"How adorable is place? Very.  I spent a lovely weekday morning here, and was so awed by all the displays and activities available. It wasn't very crowded - just a few groups on field trips at that time.   At first, I was kind of self-conscious that I went by myself, but the nice lady at the counter said that they get plenty of adult visitors who have fun there. But you know, as someone who's been studying Early Childhood Education, it was only fitting that I go, right? Why, sure.   First floor:  - Oh, come on. You know you want to touch that plasma ball.   - That rock wall? It's really for kids. I'm a little over 5 feet, and I could reach the top in two steps.   - You must see that screen with all the colors that captures your movements and poses. That is just soooo awesome. Don't be shy - dance in front of it. Jump around. You'll love it!  - Team Turtle Training Camp. That's where I sang a song about not smoking, created a well-balanced meal, and learned how to express my feelings. Yup.  - There's a mat where you can practice your *STOP, DROP, & ROLL* skills. In the same area, you can learn how to make emergency phone calls.  (Uh, no, I didn't do that.)  - I found out I can throw a baseball at 30something mph, and reaffirmed that I can't throw a football to save my life.  - The theater is nice and cozy, but I had just missed the show. I did get to take a picture with Stuffie, though. (And I'm still sad I accidentally deleted it.)  - THE PULLEYS. Those were so much fun, as was the lever and this other corner where you can capture your shadow. (Tip: close your eyes as the flash is about to go off, because that is freakishly bright.)   SECOND FLOOR:  - The bathroom is something spectacular.  - There's a play area for the very little kids. I'm sure if I were two years old, I would have loved it.   - I'm quite impressed by the exhibit dedicated to the eye. It's like all the information on the eye that I learned in elementary school was crammed into this place.   - As sticky as it was, I did like to play with bubbles. I didn't get to stand in this one place where you can try to enclose yourself in a giant bubble, though.  - The roleplay areas were so cool! I wish I had a big cabin, a canoe, a crane, a ship, and a cafe to play with ... even now. And that grocery store where you can actually ""go shopping"" and stand in a ""Three items or less"" line? How precious is that?  - I loved the Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood exhibit. Wow, what a fit of nostalgia that gave me. I could play in the Neighborhood of Make-Believe. I could even open a closet and put on a sweater. You know, if I wanted to.   There's something so fun about acting like a kid, and this was a place where I could do just that. For a ""grown-up,"" this place would probably be boring. It may seem small, but it's probably the size of a country to some child. Say what you want, but it was like a big playground for me. I love how something so simple can bring you back to that attitude of a child, where everything is so interesting and so new.  I thought this place was great for both adults (with some use of the imagination, of course) and children, and so worth the $7 admission. If I ever find myself in New Orleans, I'd definitely visit again.  (PS - the website says you can rent the museum?! And we're not talking about for your nephew's sixth birthday party - but a reeeal event. HOW AWESOME. Okay, now I wish I lived nearby so I could take advantage of that.)"
2518,Bon Ton Cafe,29.949599499999998,-90.06814399999999,16.0,"We went here for their New Years Eve dinner. They kept trying to change our reservations on us which was odd. They tried to move our 9 pm reservations up to 5 pm on the day of. Which was not possible. Then they finally agreed to a 7:30 pm time. We had made these reservations weeks before and had planned our travel arrangements around it. Not the best start. We rushed to get ready and get there.   The menu was limited. I had the redfish bon ton which was rather bland even with what looked like a nice crust of seasoning. Another person at the table had the oysters alvin and said she felt like she could get the same thing for much less and with more flavor anywhere else. I tried the gumbo for an appetizer, again rather bland and lots of crab/shrimp shells. By dessert there were 3 options: bread pudding, butter pecan ice cream, or bread pudding with the butter pecan ice cream. Most of our party opted for the third option and all we could say was that it was good but that the whiskey was really overpowering. Taking a bite was like taking a shot. We enjoyed mediocre coffee and left with a nearly $700 check for 6 people with $80 a plate and 2 bottles of wine--we figured that wasn't too bad. But we did feel that we overpaid for rather bland food and a just ok atmosphere. We were rather packed in and it was hard to get out from the table and to the restroom. Lots of climbing and squeezing between chairs.   The reviews that say go to mothers down the street are right. We did that on the last day of our trip and were not disappointed. Far more flavorful for a good bit less money."
2274,Satsuma Café,29.963811,-90.042971,17.0,I really like this place. Their bread selection is great and the food is good with reasonable prices. My favorite is the green eggs and ham croissant. Its seasoned perfectly. I normally take off some of the onion but that's just my preference. I ordered the special BLT and felt it needed 100% more bacon on it. That would be my only con here. Note they don't have as many flavored syrup options as other coffee shops. I'll go back!
3254,Envie Espresso Bar & Cafe,29.95373,-90.06534,16.0,"Honestly don't understand why there are any bad reviews here. I come here at least twice a week or more and the coffee here is the epitome of perfection, I'm obsessed with their almond croissants, the staff is always so lovely; shoutout to Andy he always makes me different latte art every time I come in.

1319,A Gallery For Fine Photography,29.9542859,-90.06682109999998,18.5,"I tell all my friends who visit New Orleans to go here even if they aren't interested in photography because after viewing this diverse and historic collection of photos they will probably develop an interest they never knew they had. Josh Pailet has amassed an amazing museum-quality collection of photographs and art books with both historical and artistic significance. He and his colleague, Eddie, treat every visitor with respect regardless if you're new to the photography world or looking for your next Newton. If you have a question, they will take the time to educate you about the pieces on display regardless of your interest in purchasing a photo. For amateur collectors or enthusiasts, it's nice to be able to enter such an unpretentious space and really be able to appreciate the art before committing to whether you want to become a collector. For more expert collectors, this place is internationally known for its taste and professionalism. In addition, if you're new to NOLA or just passing through, Josh and Eddie are lifelong New Orleanians who would be happy to share tips about their favorite local spots to check out. If you're lucky enough to be in town for an opening, the artists and the crowds they draw always make for an interesting evening with good conversation. This place is not to be missed!"

3136,The Jung Hotel Lobby Restaurant & Lounge,29.9578201,-90.0754427933,13.0,"We ate here for quick and convenient lunch and my husband and I ordered the same thing, French onion soup and a Caesar salad. The salad was a good portion size, dressing was not very creamy but it was good! Protein was not included as an option so price options weren't on the menu. I had shrimp, which was very good. We were asked what protein we wanted and I suppose I should have realized it was extra or asked the cost. Didn't find out the cost until we got the check which was a ""fun"" surprise. The broth of the onion soup was delicious but the soup needed way more cheese and the crouton topping was not crisp at all, instead was soggy. Service was excellent though and the restaurant is very pretty."

Regardless, their merchandise is appealing as long as it remains logo-free.    It was a fairly large sized store.  The sales staff was super friendly.  I always appreciate good customer service.    I haven't been to any Coach store in awhile so I have somehow missed out on the fact that they sell reasonably priced jewelry! There were some really cute earrings and bracelet's.  It was the first stop on my first full day in NOLA so I opted to skip.  Besides, I can always buy Coach at home.  Regardless, this is a great location."

There is a dedicated elevator that brings guests directly up to the roof. The door or ""elevator"" man was pretty funny as the girls in the elevator with us commented on his pretentious attitude. Expected from a doorman at a swanky spot like this. Only enjoyed one drink but enjoyed the view and the crowd was lively. Also had some great music which I expect was from a DJ."

Light enough of allow the banana and clove flavors of the weiss to shine.  The other weiss was brewed with elderberries ('Elderweiss') was good.  Heavier, though IMHO the lesser of the two offered weiss brews.  Lots of room to play on the patio.  Interesting array of beer offerings.  Note their pricing is a tad aggressive  ($9-$10 for 16 oz of their higher ABV choices).  Nonetheless - worth checking out if you are into micro-brews.  This is not just another cookie-cutter brewery."
2100,Bayona,29.9573006,-90.0680821,3.0,"We came here for late lunch Saturday, so got to pick three small plates from the menu. The cocktail menu looked delicious, but we settled on sharing a bottle of moderately priced Gruner. I'm a HUGE seafood fan, so was disappointed to hear that they were already out of the scallop and pampano plates. Instead I chose to start with the garlic soup, which was yummy. Next I had the oysters, which were pretty darn good. Finally came the shrimp (the substitution item for scallops prepared the same way) and they were fantastic...and they even included one little scallop as a surprise! The food was good, but the atmosphere and staff were sort of stiff, which perhaps took away from the experience. If I came back, I would like to sit out in the courtyard."

925,Town and Country,29.938572999999998,-90.0754369,19.0,"Do not give this store your business.  I made an appointment 3 weeks in advance to try on wedding dresses.  My godmother drove in from 2 hours away, my mother took off work early and one of my bridesmaids rearranged her schedule to attend the dress shopping session.  When we arrived to the store they had a handmade sign on a scrap of paper saying they closed at 3:30 (scratched out) 2:30 p.m. that day.  I could see two ladies through the window in the store so I knocked, thinking well maybe they closed to walk-ins but I had an appointment so surely they were expecting me.  One of the women started to walk towards the door pointing to the sign saying they were closed.  I said, ""but I have an appointment.""  She shook her head no and pointed to the sign.  This went on for about a minute before she finally cracked the door open and said, ""we're closed.""  I repeated, ""but I have an appointment.""  And she tells me, ""No you don't.""  Which blew me away.  I know I made the appointment I had a 10 minute conversation with the woman on the phone when I made the appointment.  I reassure her I have an appointment and she once again tells me ""No you don't.  Are you sure you actually made an appointment.""  The woman just kept repeating we're closed there is no one here to help you.  And telling me I didn't have an appointment.  She made zero efforts to resolve the situation.  She didn't offer to reschedule my appointment or even invite us in to discuss options.  She had a very bad attitude and was super unfriendly.  She was very rude and clearly didn't care to have our business.  Save yourself the trouble and visit a store that cares about their customers."
969,Nola Rock Co.,29.960873600000003,-90.0588503,18.0,"Love this store! Went to Nola for Mardi Gras and came across this super cute crystal store above the French quarter. It has a huge assortment of gem stones -  in tumbled variety and also for display and healing purposes.   The jewelry pieces are quite unique and affordable for the quality they have. I ended up buying a pyrite ring and tumbled stone after I had left Nola already. Communication and shipping was quick and efficient.   If you're in town, you should definitely stop by here, if only to get your crystal fix on."
2711,Toups South,29.9408344,-90.07910090000001,17.0,"We arrived at bit after 3:00 for the Happy Hour per the website. The museum was wonderful, but there was some confusion as to whether we could get the admission discount if we were going to have drinks and happy hour food rather than dinner. The lovely clerk gave us that price, but we felt vaguely guilty. Then, the bartender was extremely overwhelmed despite the fact that the restaurant was not at all full. There was one large party that appeared to be a wedding or bachelorette celebration, and the drinks for that had her terribly backed up. Consequently, service was terrible. After we'd gotten drinks and wandered the (wonderful!) museum, we tried to go back to the bar to order some food and another drink. The bar was full and there was no host station or any server to direct us to a table. No one made eye contact, and unwilling to do the work ourselves, we settled our tab and left. When we settled the tab no one asked us how everything was, did we want anything else, etc. In all, the staff were friendly, but seemed overwhelmed and confused."
756,Bayou Oaks at City Park - South Course,30.01114,-90.08873100000001,19.0,"Best kept course in the New Orleans metro area, especially the greens.  It is also one of the best draining courses around, unless mother nature drops 7"" of rain in a 2 hour period!  The course can play as hard or as easy as you want measuring all the way to 7300 yards.  The pace of play is also very good, even on the weekends, as long as you don't get stuck behind a bunch of hacks that slow the entire course up.  Thankfully they have marshals on both nines that will speed the slower players up so that 4 people don't ruin the experience for the other 100 people that are behind them!"

We went to see how it was, (never going to a male entertainment place before) we were just hoping to have a good time, and man was it that! The club was full, all the dancers were fit & attractive. Not to mention the best looking one, Blake. Tall and a fireman how could you resist. He was very friendly and could carry on a convo, so you could tell it wasn't just all about the money. He could dance good and we will definitely be going back! Thanks for the experience! Omg!"

1657,Hard Rock Cafe,29.9544186,-90.0645593,18.0,"Your standard Hard Rock Cafe. It was a breath of fresh air to the overwhelming fried seafood everywhere else. We had a turkey burger with alfalfa spouts. It was pretty good. A little pricey, but you're paying for the rock-star ambiance. Great location. Service was poor, but that's not uncommon for HRC's."
763,WOW Cafe & Wingery,29.922534999999996,-90.1214605,2.0,I used to go to the Uptown WOW Wingery every now and then while I worked nearby. The service was generally ok but the food just wasn't that good. It was the type of place that I just wouldn't have gone to if it weren't within walking distance.   I'm divided between two and three stars on this place. It's just not memorable.
2504,Chateau Moanèt Voilà,29.953597700000003,-90.06542309999999,4.0,"I was at Voila during Jazz Fest to listen to a friend's brother play some excellent tunes, and even though I didn't have a drink that night, the atmosphere was calm at 9:30-10:30 and the numerous couches and chairs were comfortable.  The sound technician wasn't overzealous with volume, and the people I was with had some good local beer."
1093,Magasin Vietnamese Cafe,29.9209952,-90.0991277,17.0,"As many other yelpers have stated, I've been dying for this place to open since I moved in around the corner. They finally opened during the course of the week leading up to Mardi Gras, and I couldn't be more excited for it.   Walking into the Magasin, you'll get a very upscale, trendy vibe to the place. Everything is sleek and new, and quite impressive. I'm a fan of their lighting, but that's another story.   I was salivating at the menu upon first glance. I settled on their Pho my first go around, and I was so very satisfied. Their presentation is flawless, and their amazing food just makes the whole experience even more delightful. Yes, they may only have one size to their Pho bowls, but to be honest, that could be the least of my concerns. I've since gone back and tried numerous menu items - among my favorites are the Spicy Beef Noodle Soup, the Grilled Shrimp Spring Rolls, and the BBQ Pork Vermicelli Noodle Bowl. Tasty, Tasty, Tasty.   At the moment, they're still in their first few weeks of being open. They have a delightful owner (who even let my roomie and I be served before they opened for dinner the other day!), and staff who are very eager and apologetic for mistakes made. I haven't had a problem waiting for my food, as all of the times I have gone there, my food has been brought to me in under 10 minutes. I've had to wait longer at numerous other restaurants, so I don't see the wait for food as an issue.   Cost wise, Magasin is super affordable, with most meals costing under $10. I love meals that don't break my bank and Magasin caters to these needs.   A few tips - Magasin is BYOB (no corking fees), they do take-out, avoid the busy hours of the day (i.e. 12pm, 6-7ish). I haven't had a problem yet rolling in around 5:30, right when they start up dinner, or a little after the lunch crowd.   To make a long story short, this is my new go to Pho shop. It may not be like those Pho shops on the westbank, but I've fallen in love with Magasin, and will continue to visit this darling shop frequently. I've been going back continually, and quite frankly, you should give it a shot."
2850,We Never Close PO-Boys,30.0187997,-89.9665875,7.0,"Massive sandwiches and a fine selection of menu items, especially if you're in the mood for Cajun food a la carte. There's so much meat or seafood stuffed into their po-boys that you'll almost wonder if you should take out some and save it for a second po-boy later. It's seedy, with dubious stains on the ceiling tiles and walls (don't sit down anywhere while you wait for your order), but it's a beacon in New Orleans East."
138,Nola T-Shirt of the Month Club,29.924946604899997,-90.085025273,17.0,"As we all know there's t-shirt shops all over the world or everyone is making t-shirts. But this special New Orleans T-shirt shop is like no other in New Orleans and they have proven that with their different seasons of shirts. They're funny sense of humor. Or the way they make us feel during this quarantine craziness that's going on. And so to tell you how crazy their customers are... I pass up tons of t-shirt shops just to come to their shop on Magazine Street. Coming all the way from the Lower Ninth Ward to get t-shirts,socks, candles or mask. That's right you heard me out loud I come all the way from the lower 9th Ward just to get a simple custom-made mask. When you have quality items I tend so cling 2 you with my money lol not the stalking type but the I know you put quality stuff out and I must have it... This is my go to shop for Myself, Family and Friends."
2376,The Barre Code New Orleans - Lakeview,30.004989000000002,-90.105909,18.0,"As a recent Barre convert, I was super excited to sign up for the Groupon offer. I've attended the TBC and the Barre Code class.... so far!  The studio has more of a gym-ey feel to it, but in a way that demonstrates they know their audience and creates a fun, working-out community. They have lockers available and socks for sale. The studio itself is long mirrored room, so you have space on the barre no matter the size of the class. The instructors have microphones and actively adjust the music and lighting. It was all very professional.  Both classes were high energy. The emphasis is on making the most of your time there, and I've both classes were very effective & efficient. TBC incorporates cardio... which is my favorite part of anything. The transitions between cardio and strength were very smooth -- again it all seemed very professional and smooth. Oh, they also made good use of the equipment in class, so if you want to be more challenged, there's a lots of opportunity for that!  I'm all about people getting the right workout in for them. For me, I felt like I needed a little more stretch time between segments and if I were brand new, I may have needed more personal guidance than was available with the microphone. However, I will definitely be incorporating Barre Code into my workout options.  Other FYIs: -They use the MindBody client portal. -They seem to have a regular set of guys that go! -The Harrison Ave. has parking options, coffee stops for after (love Nola Beans), and a little grocery, so you can really hit all your errands at once."

2056,The Old Coffee Pot Restaurant,29.958158100000002,-90.0651605,16.0,"I'm terribly disappointed to see how badly this place has declined. It seems that since they were featured on the Food Network they think they are celebrities, and that they are doing you a favor by allowing you to dine there. I lived in New Orleans for ten years pre-Katrina, and had remembered the Coffee Pot as a charming, old-school restaurant with great food and friendly service. I was shocked at how poorly we were treated, and embarrassed that I brought my friends there, some of whom had never been to New Orleans before.   I would like to begin by saying that I have worked in the restaurant industry my entire life, I am beyond patient and understanding when dining out, but there is absolutely no excuse for the way we were treated. We went for brunch on Sunday, 3/1. There was a bit of a line, but it was moving quickly so we decided to wait. What a mistake! As we got closer to the front, we were greeted by a surly hostess who seemed annoyed that we were there. She asked how many were in our party, gave us a severe look, and disappeared.   We were eventually sat at a table with no menus and waited. And... waited. For a long time. Eventually a waitress shuffled over. At this moment my friend had been showing me a photo on her phone, and our waitress barked at us in a caustic tone to, ""Put your toys away."" She dropped menus on our table and disappeared without taking a drink order.   Again we waited. We had more than enough time to read the entire menu, decide what we wanted to eat and drink, even had time leftover to discuss the weather, this year's Jazz Fest lineup, and the meaning of life. When our waitress finally returned with water, she again admonished us to put our ""toys"" away, and vanished without taking a drink or food order.   We continued to wait helplessly, and at this point I'm getting annoyed. Any restaurant that's been open this long should know well enough that a drink order should have been taken by now. After we'd been sitting for nearly 25 minutes, we looked around for our waitress and realized that she was just standing in the window of the kitchen, waiting for food to come up.   Now look, the place was not understaffed. There were three waitresses on the floor and what appeared to be a hostess that was helping bus tables and make drinks. The place is tiny, and the outdoor seating was closed save for two tables. They were full, but not even close to being busy enough to justify such slow service, although as another reviewer mentioned, the entire staff has a serious lack of time-management skills. Even harder to justify, however, is the attitude we were getting from everyone.   I finally went over to the kitchen/bar area and asked the woman behind the bar if someone could take our food and drink order. She didn't seem too interested in helping me, but did ask who our waitress was. At this point, our ""waitress"" turned around and asked in a hostile tone, ""What's the problem over there?""  Excuse me? What's the problem? The problem is that it's been almost a half an hour since I sat down and I'd like to order something to eat and drink! She yelled at me that she was waiting for another table's food to come up and that when it was ready and she had dropped it off, she would be over to take our order. ARE YOU EFFING KIDDING ME??   After almost ten more minutes she came over to take our order, and hostilely asked us for ID when we ordered alcoholic beverages. She did manage to take our food order at the same time, however she made several mistakes with our entire order, including bringing potatoes when we asked for grits and forgetting to bring a beverage my friend had ordered. She also had to come back because she forgot what side dish we had ordered. She made a lame attempt to try to backpedal on her former hostility, but the damage was done. I will give credit where credit is due, the food was good enough, the grits were fantastic, although they had clearly used frozen spinach on my eggs sardou, and the hollandaise was bland.   Here's the final insult, they had the nerve to add an 18% gratuity to our bill, and we were only a party of four! This was not stated ANYWHERE on the menu, trust me, I looked at the menu again to check. The fact that they were adding gratuity explains the poor service, it also explains the I-don't-give-a-shit attitude from the staff. If my one friend hadn't had to get to the airport for her flight, I would have called the manager and refused to pay the gratuity, because it is ILLEGAL to add a service charge to a bill without advance notice, they can't force you to pay it! I told the hostess how unhappy we were, she didn't seem to care.  All in all, it was a very disappointing experience. My friends who still live in New Orleans agree that the Coffee Pot has really gone downhill in recent years, especially since their Food Network ""fame."" The sad thing is that there will probably always be tourists gullible enough to go because they saw it on TV! Be warned, stay away!"
2587,Chap's Chicken,30.005555142800002,-90.1176293107,19.0,The chicken was great! I got fries and potato salad as sides. The potato salad was too vinegary or acidic to me but others might enjoy it more than me. The service was great. I felt like I was visiting a friends house and my friends mom was inviting me to eat dinner. Very friendly and accommodating. They didn't have mashed potatoes but I got fries which were very good!
1364,Brazil Taco Truck,29.9633575,-90.0575446,3.0,"BRAZIL DOES NOT HAVE TACOS, OR GORDITAS, OR TAMALES, OR BURRITOS. I am trying to understand why they would name it that way. I was looking for brazilian food in nola, but found this site instead. wth.   I find it funny that a lot of the reviewers on here said ""this is good authentic food"". AKA Greg M's comments: ""where you can feast on some authentic Brazilian tacos, burritos, & tamales."" ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME! You have obviously never been to Brazil if you were serious when you wrote that.  Sorry for the rant, but so sad that people would actually write ignorant comments like that. I'll tell you what is authentic Brazilian food. You ready!? The best PIZZA you will ever have, The best HOT DOG you will ever have, strogonoff, awesome sandwiches, black rice and white beans, sausages, steak, great salads, delicious cheese, fantastic pastries, all sorts of fruit drinks, fruit and every flavor of gelatto you could possibly think of.

297,IHOP,29.95445,-90.07052,15.0,"We visited the Ihop on Canal Street after a day of traveling and were seated by a friendly waitress. In our group, there were two adults and four children, ages 14, 13, 5 and 3. The waitress brought our drinks and took our order quite efficiently. When the food arrived, one five-stack of buttermilk pancakes were missing. My daughter had to sit and watch everyone eat for some time, while the waitress made promises each trip past our table. Knowing she was starving, I finally gave her one f my three pancakes so she had something in front of her while she waited.  Finally, her order arrived and she began eating. The waitress left my bill on the table - $54. I had ordered the Colorado Omelette which was quite good but when I finished most of it and started on my pancakes, I got a nasty nasty surprise. With the second bite of my pancakes, something felt wrong in my mouth. I reached in and found a hair. I started pulling it out of my mouth and it kept coming and coming, like a fishing line!!! UGH MY GAWD. The thing took both hands and turned out to be a curly reddish hair. It was not mine nor the waitresses as it had obviously been cooked into the pancake. This made me sick to my stomach, of course.  I called the waitress over and showed her. She quickly told me the hair did not match anyone on duty (WHO CARES ABOUT THAT? THE DAMN THING WAS IN MY FOOD!) She asked me if I wanted to speak to the manager and I said no, please just take this food away from the table. She did not ask me if I wanted a replacement (even though I would have said no, it would have been nice if she had offered). She came back to the table a few minutes later and picked up the $54 check, leaving another in its place. I thought maybe she had took my meal off of the bill but NO - now my total was $63.89. Listed as a service charge was $7.73 - she had included her own gratuity after the hair was found.   IHOP used to be my ultimate favorite restaurant but now it just makes my stomach churn and brings back a memory I cannot erase. I will never, ever return to this restaurant and unless something changes in the future, I will never eat at another IHOP err... IHAIR again!!!    And since when did IHOP start adding gratuity into their checks?????????????????"
2139,Slice Pizzeria,29.9389437,-90.0759998,14.0,"Something happened to this place. It used to be good, but it's gone really downhill. My recent visit was terrible. Everything tasted really stale, pizza was dry and stone hard, and the staff wasn't really friendly. It was so disappointing. I used to love this place, but after this last experience, I decided to move on to other better places in town."

My friend put hot sauce all over hers. Salad, fruit and chips were fresh and good.

She was really nice though and when we finally got our drinks, we had an enjoyable evening. We ordered the chargrilled oysters and calamari - both were good, but definitely not the best in the city.

They had just finished roasting it (for 8 hours) and gave us a sample. It was incredible. I Highly recommend Fharmacy."
1007,Pizza Hut,29.9280059677,-90.06869622389999,2.5,"Have been waiting over 3 hours for our delivery pizza and it still has not arrived. Called a half hour ago and they said it was on the way, we live just a few miles from this location. This is twice now that I've waited a ridiculous amount of time for a delivery, I will not give them a third chance. Do yourself a favor and order from anyone else, especially if you'd like your food before the next day."
3277,C4 Tech & Design,29.936762654899997,-90.0693419413,21.0,Extremely helpful and made sure I understood the process along the way.  Well-priced and great personal service!
1102,A and M Food Store,29.967947913699998,-90.0619258359,4.0,Absolutely great local family owned convince store! Great prices and selection. Amazing liquor and craft beer selection.
717,CBD Social,29.9470993544,-90.07149277549999,3.0,"They advertise crawfish at cost for locals. This is a total scam. They charge $15/3lbs. That's totally not cost. Even rouses sells them for $2.29/lb. when I asked about the price, I was told, ""Well there is the owner right there. The crawfish are $3/lb and the fixings are $2.""  So clearly she is used to this questions and by ""fixings"" she means pineapple and okra. What the actual fuck. Also the shot of Jameson I had was $8 and served in a cup that would be too small to take a full dose of NyQuil in.  It was most certainly less than an ounce. For EIGHT DOLLARS. I had 15 pounds of crawfish, 5 beers and 2 drops of jamo and my tab was $70. That is certainly no discount. Maybe it is in Brooklyn where that hipster ass owner is from."
1286,The Balcony Kitchen,29.924129100000002,-90.08667729999999,7.5,We ordered pizza online at 12:45am they didn't close until 2:00am and email confirmation shows 20-30 minutes.  30 minutes pasted so I called to make sure they got the order.  They confirmed and said it was out for delivery.  It is now 2:14am and they never delivered the pizza. I don't recommend this place.
120,Café at The Square,29.9492153,-90.0706026,16.0,"Like many other reviewers I passed by this place a number of times before looking it up on Yelp and realizing that I really did need to give it a shot... Wow... I was not disappointed! We started out with the crab cake appetizer- it was very well portioned (2 large crab cakes) and the sauce with it had an interesting hint of dill (just lovely and refreshing and a little different). We were feeling like comfort food and had the chicken tenders-  The portions were very generous and the food was just solid.  Not fussy or stuffy or trying hard... just good, wholesome and good to eat. The service was fine- however there is only one waitress for the tables and the bar, so i can imagine that if it is full that would cause some delays.  Overall it was just a lovely meal and the prices were unbelievably reasonable (most places have crabcakes 1/2 that size for twice that price)... The ambiance is nice, nothing crazy but it is just a very nice option with reasonable prices and lovely food!"
3425,Mister Gregory's,29.961394,-90.067367,17.0,"Okay this place was...okay.  A tiny space with a few iron chairs and tables strewn about does not equal good atmosphere to me. I paid almost $30 for two small bowls of Mac and cheese, tiny salad and bottled water.  the Brie Mac and cheese was very good but if I'm going to spend that much for a simple brunch there are far better places in town to do so. Can't see myself going back"
2747,Cure,29.934988,-90.1075696,4.0,"Sexy space, hipster crowd, cute appetizers, and fancy cocktails. But some of those fancy cocktails (and I can't remember which ones, I admit) didn't taste as good as they sounded in the menu. And since I don't remember which ones were icky, let's just say avoid the fancy cocktails and go straight for the hard stuff."
2788,Gautreau's Restaurant,29.9299019826,-90.1097052207,2.0,"Wow - seriously under whelmed. the serve was not personable. Menus and later all dishes were dropped with no details or even a simple ""enjoy"". The waiter could not give good recommendations regarding entree choice. So we, started with duck based on other yelp reviews - it was the best dish of the night. the filet was cooked well but very uninventive - very bland. I should have asked for steak sauce. The red snapper was dry. Three glasses of wine later and two deserts and no sign of the server - the maitre d' finally stopped by to ask how the meal was and we finally had the chance to inquire on the flavors of sorbet.   All in all a very disappointing ""gem""."
3115,Temptations,29.9560809,-90.0681622,6.5,Brittney the bartender was amazing. She made our bachelor party experience amazing.  The specials at this place are great and recommended to anyone looking to have a good time.
2869,Le Petit Bistro,29.9857902565,-90.25440281280001,18.0,"Just keep walking when you see this place.   Employees really preferred to chat with each other as opposed to help me.    The place is expensive, even for airport food.   I got red beans and rice with sausage. My plate included one piece of sausage. No, not one link of sausage, rather one slice of sausage about 3/4"" think. This was very close to a vegetarian option."
2169,3 Southern Girls,29.9592843,-90.1719775,19.0,This was my first time trying 3 southern girls and I must say I was impressed the food was simple but with a lot of flavor good job ladies you have a customer for life good thing my job not far can't wait to try the whole menu today I had the chicken wings with mac and cheese potato salad and peas the only thing I was missing was the bread but I didn't  need it this food is good
163,Key's Food Store,29.937295000000002,-90.0961002,17.0,Love Keys chicken plates! It's very few places in New Orleans with amazing customer service!
1261,Russell's Marina Grill,30.0213474,-90.11427409999999,16.0,Can't wait to try more from this place in our neighborhood. The burger was almost as good as Yo Mama's. Fantastic!
1233,Anita's Restaurant,29.9587817,-90.08462390000001,15.0,"3.5 Rating but if I had to round off my review then up is where I'll take it without a 2nd guess  First, the Cons: It's not really a 24hr spot, and yes I found that out the hard way with a full on hardcore crave, so call ahead of time for the hours.  Second, they don't serve French toast which is personally my favorite and how can you do breakfast with no French Toast.  Fair Warning: It's a cash only establishment but they do have an ATM in the diner.  The Pros: A healthy amount I must say. My usual are grill chicken with Grits, and a waffle which all does a stomach good. They are good with altering specials, also the place just seems real. So, actually there's not much to say about this place, but only that it's good, not a chain, and they deserve your business."
2479,Helix Wine Bar,29.9437211,-90.0722118,16.0,A very nice upscale lounge. Grey goose and cranberry was $8 but was stiff. Attended a friends b-day celebration. It took the DJ awhile before the music started but definitely a nice place to relax and socialize.
2636,New Orleans Coffee & Beignet,29.945984999999997,-90.0669762,15.0,"This place often gets mistaken for New Orleans Coffee and Beignets, but they have everything and better. We were just about to leave after being seated when the waitress stopped us and asked us what exactly we were looking for. We showed them photos and realized we were in the right place! THE PHOTOS AND PLACE IS DIFFERENT. WE WERE AT LEGACY KITCHEN. The food and service was excellent, the nutty buddy coffee is pretty sweet but the vanilla cortada is good. I got a make shift Shrimp and Grits with egg, like the one in a photo I showed. So good. BLT was standard."
1683,Subway,29.9549939,-90.0751027,18.0,There is another subway a few blocks over.  Go there instead.  This one is a little dirty and the prices are ridiculous.
395,Laurel Street Bakery,29.951621999999997,-90.09983199999999,15.0,"This is a great little neighborhood cafe. They offer baked goods, sandwiches and breakfast sandwiches, salads and a variety of coffees and tea. Their bagels aren't the best in the city, but they are soft and tasty.   I really like their breakfast sandwiches. My favorite is the American - egg, bacon, tomato and American cheese on an everything bagel. I also like the salads here - fresh ingredients, generous portions and a great value at $8 each.   The space is very clean, nice and bright, well organized and seating is usually plentiful. They have wifi and it's a nice space to work in for a while too."
2122,The Creole Cottage,29.933665500000004,-90.07265109999999,21.0,Best place to get affordable classy furniture in New Orleans!  All of their stuff is one of a kind so your home won't look like it fell out of a Pottery Barn catalogue and the prices cannot be beat.
975,Ohm Lounge,29.9473851,-90.06759659999999,5.0,Was there last week had the best time ever never imagined a place like this existed in New Orleans. One off my best friends out of Nola told me about this place so I decided to check it out for my self. The atmosphere is killer the Asian themed tapas are top notch so bad that I'm craving the black cod all ready. (Tip of the day : at this place / BLACK COD)  If your into scenes and crowds this is the place to go really I've met some of the coolest people ever here.   Just check it out for your self if I was a local this would be my place.
3565,The Salvage Store,29.9427753721,-90.1871615276,20.0,I used to go to the old Suda salvage store here. Then they opened a restaurant supply store which I didn't care for. Now we're back to a salvage company. I found the price to be a little on the high side on some products but I found some real bargains as well. I would definitely go back. Happy to have a salvage store back in business. Can't beat the prices on wine. The store is much neater and better organized than it was in The suds days. I'm willing to add another star if I can find some super bargains on my next trip
2579,Retrouvailles Bistro,29.958607300000004,-90.06545679999999,4.0,"Pretty average bar in the French Quarter. There's a guy hustling outside, trying to convince everyone that their food is great. That MAY be true, but everyone who was there was there for the bar...meaning, DRINKING!  So my rating is strictly on the quality of the bar and drinks. And they weren't bad nor super pricey as they can be in the French Quarter.   But I wish I could have tried their food....it actually looks pretty good on the other Yelp reviews, but that's unfortunately not why we were there....we were there to drink, and that's what we did.  Efficient bar staff so all was good."
3120,Domino's Pizza,30.011004600000003,-90.0206692,21.0,"This was my 1st time ordering from this particular Domino's.  I didn't realize there were 2 windows because the side I came to it only look like one.  Well 2 black young ladies didn't even acknowledge me.  They look right in car, didn't smile, didn't raise a hand, or anything else.  I waited about 5 minutes then finally a young black male came up to window, acknowledge me, and he retrieved my pizza.  Do yourself a favorite and fire those 2 ladies and hire more men."
3311,AT&T,29.916063,-90.114308,18.0,THIS STORE IS NOT CLOSED!  It is a store no longer associated with being an AT&T core store.  Forget going to this store as it has horrible customer service.  I went in after going online to see how to trade in my iPhone.  Online I was given an amount which could not be honored at the store since they are not a 'core' store.   The first thing the salesperson did was remove the glass plate off of the top of my phone to see if there was any damage. I had told him in advance that the glass protector plate was applied when I initially purchased the phone so there would be no damage.  In fact it was easy to see because the protector plate was clean.  Once I was told that they could only give me half of the quoted amount because they are no longer an AT&T store they sent me to the Lakeside store.  Before I left I asked for assurance that they would be able to handle my account.  Of course I get to the Lakeside store and the salesperson smells like onions which is disgusting.  He either wants me to buy the new iPhone directly or go on the Next plan which he doesn't explain well to me at all.  I leave very frustrated and try to contact the Tchoupitoulas store to tell them I'm coming back to get my protector plate for my phone which was thrown away.  No one answers the phone after repeated calls.  Once I arrive at the Tchoup store I'm told no one answered the phone because I was calling the wrong number.  Apparently their old number is still listed in the At&T directory assistance because that is the number I was given.  The poor service only escalated and I was given back the protector plate which can't be reapplied without looking like trash.  I am a long time AT&T customer.  This is how you LOSE customers.  Skip this store and the one at Lakeside and go elsewhere for your service.
1933,Heitmeier Eyecare,29.919901899999996,-90.01688,18.0,"It is a shame to like the doctors but feel on every visit that you are ran down a assembly line- rushed in-rushed out! No wonder that their receptionist is so rude to everyone- maybe well over worked. Just called to have my name removed from the endless appointment reminders only to hear ""our system is down can you call back later""! Really, you can not WRITE down my info and enter when the system comes back up? They are herding so many people through that place from one waiting room to the next that I'm not sure any of them really know what's going on! You'll be better off going to the mall- Last, I've called now 3 times and had to leave a voice message to yet receive a call back stating that they received my surgery cancellation. The thought of surgery through this messed up clinic was more than I could handle."
2303,Dooky Chase's Restaurant,29.968130199999997,-90.0785465,17.0,"I could smell the food from the parking lot so I was anxious to eat only to be greeted by a not so friendly host who was reluctant to let me look at the menu while I waited because ""we only have 200"" and I was told my wait would be 30 mins.  Fifty mins later I was told they seated someone else under my name but I would be next.  The food was not as good as Willie Mae's and the service was horrible.  I was unable to get a refill on my water and the server appeared annoyed.   Most customers ordered the buffet so I am not sure how the servers were spending there time.  My advice would be to stop in and enjoy the art and leave!!!"
2916,NOLA FoodFest,29.9487877998,-90.0626022031,19.0,"For foodies, this is an excellent opportunity to try signature dishes from some of the best resturants in both New Orleans and the South.    Almost every dish was in the $3-$6 range.    Dishes tried included: - Oyster poboy - Crawfish louis - Alligator etouffee over grits  - Baked Alaska - Snow Balls - Strawberry Shortcake  Drinks were very moderately priced with bottled water at $1, sodas for $2, beer for $4.    There were several cajun/folk/rockabilly/swing bands that were just fun to watch.  A couple doing tap dancing was fantastic.  While not aimed at kids, I brought my four (your'e welcome) and it was a great venu to introduce them to a range of foods they'd never tried, music and dancing."
483,Gordon Biersch Brewery Restaurant,29.948039,-90.064975,16.0,We ordered to go at this restaurant bc it was just across the street from the hotel our family was staying. The host that took our order over the phone was very cordial and nice. We walk over about ten minutes after our order. We then waited about 20 min for our order to come. The brought our order and we checked to see if they got our fathers order correct because he has certain allergies.  It was.  All of our food was cold or Luke warm and we only walked a cross the street not even 5 minute walk. My burger was not cooked medium it was cooked rare. My husbands burger was fine. But the spaetzle was cold and over cooked mushy.  Very underwhelming. My husband brought my burger back and for the garlic fries they forgot to include with our order that was a free Yelp deal.    When he went back the restaurant the manager was apologetic. She took the burger off then a 25% off the total order and gave him a free Coke while he waited.
2982,Hanks Supermarket,29.968511100000004,-90.049592,7.5,"Recently changed ownership.  Now offering AMAZING Meditteranean food (Palestinian).  Ask for a plate - they will make you spicy and delicious schwarma, kebabs, humus, spinach pies for a reasonable price (unlike most places in the bywater).   I live next door and I hardly cook for myself any more."
825,Bearcat CBD,29.9452587,-90.0733993,16.0,"We enjoyed breakfast here on a Saturday during a family weekend in New Orleans. Our usual breakfast spot was fully booked and I'd heard great things about Bearcat so we decided to give the CBD location a try and it was phenomenal in every way! 5 out of 5 on everything, coffee, service, food, and atmosphere.  Our server was kind and knew the menu very well, she was also so patient and friendly with our kids which is always a plus. We enjoyed flat whites, the breakfast club, a spicy chicken biscuit w/ Cajun gravy, and the kid's short stack with fruit. Such yummy food! We were full and so satisfied. There is something for everyone on the menu with vegetarian, vegan, and meat options, plus a specials menu with incredible seasonal sides and special meals.  Two things I really appreciated were:  prices were right on all around with great portion sizes (you know how pretentious some places can get when the food is good and the prices are like 'whoa now,' not here); and the employees top down were genuinely welcoming, friendly, and seemed to love their job. To me, that automatically sets the tone and makes guests feel at home and want to return.  My single regret is not sitting outside during our visit. The back patio is seriously cool and pretty. We will be back next time we visit from Baton Rouge for sure!"
1830,Congregation Coffee,29.951917579299998,-90.0534565667,16.0,"Good quality coffee.  Breakfast on the weekends is delish too.  Our go to every time we go to New Orleans. It has been hard finding a good coffee roaster shop ever since moving from San Diego, Ca.  Your unique coffee and atmosphere makes us feel at home because we value uniqueness and quality. Thank you."
1009,Batture Bistro and Bar,29.9519718,-90.064805,21.0,Great happy hour on the edge of the French Quarter. Bartenders were friendly and the place was spotless. The pizzas were delicious. A bit expensive if not happy hour.
2592,Liberty Cheesesteaks,29.935088690100002,-90.1091585334,17.0,"Honestly, ignore everything I said before. I don't care that they didn't answer the phone the first few times I called or that they had potty mouths...I ordered one Original and one Wiz last night and ate BOTH by myself...and I just opened my eyes at 11:30 today and just ordered delivery AGAIN. Liberty is my new happy place!"
1236,Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen,29.939946999999997,-90.1018478,17.0,This is the best Popeyes I've ever had ! My chicken tenders were freshly and crispy my mashed potatoes were on point ! And a hot biscuit ! Oh and the sweet tea !
643,Elizabeth Street Cafe,29.9342468696,-90.0729055707,10.0,"Okay, I was very skeptical of this place - it seemed a little too trendy on the outside. But let me tell you, we LOVED it. For me personally, it didn't feel like a watered down version of Vietnamese food which is what I kinda expected. Overall the flavors were great and the food was delicious - I'll definitely be returning.   We started off with the steamed rice rolls which were TO DIE FOR. For real, I could eat a whole plate of these myself. Everything about this dish was delicious and the shrimp were soooo fresh.   For a main I decided to get the Banh Cuon which was very similar to the rice roll we got as an appetizer. It was delicious but I preferred the sauce with the appetizer more. My partner got the Dan Dan which was overall good but the broth lacked some flavor - needed more salt for sure, though overall not bad.   Their beignets taste straight up like toaster strudels which I enjoyed, haha!   Service was also so sweet and quick even tho they were packed.   I'm excited to come back for their happy hour and try some new things!"
311,Funky 544,29.957617600000003,-90.0664106,4.0,"Great late night spot for dancing! There isn't much to the place - pretty divey but great drinks and great live entertainment. Ladies keep an eye on your bags here - my friends phone, id, credit & debit cards were stolen here. The bathrooms weren't to gross here compared to some of the other places...And be aware of the shot girls that come around and push shots in your mouth and then you have to pay for them!! We didn't even ask for them!!!! Then they demanded $72 from us. We were there for like 3 minutes when that happened. ha. Then kept coming over to us like we were suckers. Fool us once, shame on us....fool us twice....."
966,Papier Plume,29.959553999999997,-90.063257,19.0,"So great. The shop is adorable. One of the most unique shops in the French Quarter. Great place to just look around if you're into calligraphy and hand made notebooks. They have a pen straight out of a nautilous movie that that is so fancy it comes with its own ""underwater"" display. They have journals that are covered in hand cut leather and filled with hand cut chalk art paper. The most extraordinary thing about this shop however is the staff. They are  absolutely first rate. Everyone is incredibly knowledgeable, attentive, and kind. One of them had a short conversation with my daughter in French and then spent 20 minutes showing her the wax seals. She let her do one of her choice and then take the results home at no charge. They wrapped the refillable leather journal I bought in gorgeous wrapping paper and added my choice of wax seal to that as well. I will definitely be returning. They have a website! Take a look."
1678,Mac and Moon,29.9451704,-90.0696037,3.0,"When I visit any city, the first thing I do as a ""vegan on the go"" is look for the places that will meet my dietary needs. I found this place on Yelp, just a few blocks away from the WWII National Museum. It was May 14th around 5pm, so not much was left in the case, except for some very expensive treats and some Vegan Muffins. The gentleman behind the counter was very friendly and helpful. But, being it was near the end of the day and the muffins were day old, they were a bit pricey and dry. The flavor was nice, but not as fresh. Now, again, I hit it at a Monday early evening, they were about to close up shop for the day, so options were slim. I can't blame them for that. The muffins were small and, as I said dry, for the price. I was happy to find the place and I would go back again when Visiting Nola, to see if I can hit them at the right time and have a better experience. Maybe I could try a few of the dishes that other's on Yelp seemed to like. I think the could learn a lot from Breads on Oak. It's a great start down a road that so many are not willing to take when creating Vegan delights. I wish them all the best in growth and abundance."
2228,John & Mary's Food Store,29.974768599999997,-90.0892972,16.0,"Would definitely so this again. The Viet Namese food is tasty. I will check out the soul food next time. Great selection of stuff. Take out only. Everyone was friendly, service was quick."
1489,Waffle House,30.0044619,-90.0355517,13.0,"I always thought you had to venture out to Mississippi to get a good waffle house breakfast, but I was wrong! Promptly seated by a greeter, had a fabulous waitress who tended to our every request with a smile, and all of our food was cooked perfectly! When it comes to waffle houses, this one is the jam!"
2624,Desi Vega's Steakhouse,29.9476208234,-90.071102127,2.0,"I haven't been hitting up as many high-end restaurants of late, and my bank account thanks me. But with the benefit of a group-on, I dropped in on Desi Vega's Steakhouse and had an excellent meal.  We made reservations for 8 p.m. on a Friday evening with just a few days lead time, so it's not packed, but clearly did need the reservations. Parking was a little challenging, but not awful, and I could have used valet if I was so inclined. The manager was very helpful from the start; we were a bit early, but we ordered drinks and when the table was ready quickly, they simply brought the drinks to our table. It's a relatively small place with windows all around that look out on Lafayette Square and St. Charles Avenue. I wouldn't say it's a romantic place at all, but a nice place with some ""buzz"" going on. I'm thinking it's the type of place where people like to be seen. It was loud, but not overwhelming and the tables had good space between them, so you had privacy. As far as atmosphere, I would give it a 23 out of 30 - and most of the points come off because of my own preference for a little more relaxed of an atmosphere.  Jumping into the food, it was very good. I had a filet, which was pricey ($41) but very good. I added the crab meat and asparagus (thumbs up) as well. The meat comes on a crazy sizzling hot plate; the sizzling meat sound with the smell is always a good thing. One key thing is that vegetarians can eat here! There are a handful of options, so don't be scared by the ""steakhouse"" name. The Mac and cheese was considered a specialty of the place, but I wasn't impressed, nothing bad, just nothing spectacular. One of the appeals was that they have Pappy Van Winkle (15-year). It was $26 for a glass and it was very tasty. Overall on food, I will give this a 42 out of 50. All was very good, but nothing blew me away.  The service was top-notch. I'm not even sure how it could be any better. We were seated very quickly, nearly exactly at 8 p.m. We had multiple waiters and everything was prompt without seeming rushed. I'm trying to knock points off, but the only issue might have been a little wait to actually get the bill - but in some ways, that's appreciated, they weren't looking to run us out. I'll give it a 19 out of 20 for service.  Final score = 84. (I created a restaurant ranking system which includes a total of 100 points: 50 for food, 30 for atmosphere and 20 for service)."
2194,Bud's Broiler,29.9824220983,-90.1102110118,19.0,"I wish I didn't have to choose 2 stars, but they left me no choice. We didn't mind waiting in line on a Friday evening, so that has nothing to do with it. We do have a problem with COLD French fries and hamburgers, which weren't taken to go but to a picnic table 20 feet away from where they were made. The best assumption is that they were put on the tray and waited while they fried the onion rings. Big disappointment."
2489,Hermes Bar,29.956996500000002,-90.0664927,18.0,"If I lived in New Orleans, this is where I would think a lot of business deals go down.  The bar is absolutely beautiful with the wood accents everywhere.  The chandeliers and lighting made it feel like I was rubbing elbows with big wigs while sipping cocktails and smoking cigars (no smoking inside unfortunately but the place definitely has that cigar bar atmosphere).  We arrived too early for the appetizers from the kitchen which all looked mouth watering but we had plenty of great cocktails.  I had a Vodka Martini, Sazerac, and a few others that now escape me.  A great time was had by all and I'll definitely need to stop back in during my next visit to the big easy."

The shop is beautifully curated with unique pieces and home goods, and is the perfect representation of New Orleans eclectic style. The sales girls are all so sweet and amazing, and 'Moonstruck Cher' has helped me on multiple occasions find great pieces! One of my favorite shops here by far."
1643,Soul's Seafood Market,29.937462899999996,-90.0904676,19.5,"It's near my home, so I should frequent it, right? Well, I may change my mind. Permanently. My last visit, between the size of the crawfish, the sub-par french bread (Hello? Liedenheimer's is just down da' street, yo?), and the suspect oysters, I just can't give you my money anymore.  Service is fast and friendly, but no debit or credit cards?   Sad."
2326,Vincent's Italian Cuisine,29.941855800000003,-90.1323062,2.0,"My husband and I just had dinner at Vincent's tonight, and we both had a great experience there. Our food was excellent, and the wait staff was very attentive. It seemed like our waiter was keeping an eye on us as we ate our soup and salad so he could bring out the entrees in a timely manner after we were finished, which was a nice touch. We finished our meal with couple coffees and a slice of tiramisu, which was the most divine tiramisu I've ever had! Seriously, if you've still got room after dinner, get a slice. You won't be disappointed! Side note: be sure to get a reservation; it's a busy restaurant at dinner time."
3215,Igor's Lounge & Game Room,29.934534999999997,-90.0805199,7.0,"This is my local watering hole, so I may be a bit biased. I've been coming here since August, and the service has always been excellent. Friendly, hard-working staff, decent bar food, stiff drinks, and an eclectic crowd keep me coming back. Karaoke and trivia nights are always entertaining. My only complaint is that they don't use tomatoes when they dress your sandwich. (Try the cajun burger anyway.) Open 24 hours, which is a big plus."
159,McDonald's,30.0042438706,-90.0364068849,14.0,"NASTY NASTY NASTY!!!!!! Steer clear.  I've been told they've had trouble with the Board of Health on several separate occasions.  I live very near here and I won't even get a cup of coffee from here (I drive to the one on Elysian Flds & I-610).    The last time I visited this restaurant was in 2006 and the staff were rude, incompetent, impatient & unprofessional.  I don't get anything from here.  I ignore this place and avoid it like the plague!"

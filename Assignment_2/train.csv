Sadly, this is not always the case in any fast food. Plus, the place was surprisingly clean - not like hospital clean, but cleaner than 95% of other fast food places I've been in.

Tried a patty melt, delicious. Apps were like these pretzel bits with cheese sauce and another was fried cheese bites with ham and red sauce. Both were good, though the cheese bites were definitely different probably something German people are down with.   Had the zwickle and also the brown ale for beers. The brown one was super chocolatey which was interesting. Great addition to the hood, especially with Tips right by.",Nightlife

82,Zimmer's Seafood,30.0083429,-90.06444029999999,18.0,"If you're ever in the mood for an affordable and tasty Po'Boy in the Gentilly area, make sure you stop at Zimmers. I spent a lot of time working in the Gentilly area/Upper 9th ward and used to stop into Zimmers pretty frequently. It's a charming family owned and operated spot that is usually jam packed during the lunch rush. If you're in a rush, it would definitely behoove you to order ahead so you don't spend your entire lunch break waiting in line. The staff is always very friendly and personable so sometimes, you actually forget how long you were waiting in line. Their marinated crab legs/claws are wonderful but for me, their true standout is the crab cake patty po'boy. I truly feel like it's the best seafood po'boy in town! It's incredibly filling (it has 3-4 crab cake patties) and will only run you about 12 bucks.    Although I only have rave reviews about Zimmers, I am only going to give it 4 stars because of their hours. They are closed Sundays and Mondays and usually close at 6 so if you work a traditional M-F 9-5 you may not really have a chance to experience the magic of Zimmers, as you should.",Restaurants

1010,The Daily Beet,29.923227,-90.0878542,18.0,"From a stand in St Roch to a corner shop downtown, The Daily Beet has now expanded Uptown, with a sunny new location and a slightly different menu. It's a sort of counterculture in New Orleans in that it offers healthy food that might be best described as ""flexitarian""; not 100% vegetarian but you can pretty much certainly eat there regardless of your diet. They don't have anything fried, and most of it is based around fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. And most importantly, it's delicious.  Among my few sources of disappointment were my discovery that despite the fact that their breakfast is offered ""all day"", the thing I really wanted to order, pancakes, is only offered until 2:00, which is not all day. However, there was plenty else on the menu to try, and my ""chimi chimi"" bowl yielded a hearty quinoa-based salad with avocado and feta and pumpkin seeds. Plenty of substance. I also went for an almond-based smoothie. It took a while, and frankly they seemed a bit confused on the service end, but it delivered the full mix of sweet and nutty flavors I'd hoped for when it arrived.  The food is eclectic and not overly specific to New Orleans or any other culture, but frankly this place strikes me as the way I should be eating. The main reason I don't visit the other Daily Beets more is that the locations aren't that convenient to me, despite them being open seven days and for generous hours. This new shop is larger and easier to park near, and while it may stand out from the New Orleans food scene as compared to other areas where this sort of food is more common, I think I'd visit it again if it were anywhere in the world.",Restaurants

The only thing that has really changed is the neighborhood.  Use to be just The Frenchmen, Checkpoint Charlies & Snug Harbor in this area.  Now it's THE place to be for live music & the great location.  This room was bigger than any I have stayed in there, with a king bed & balcony overlooking Frenchmen Street.  If you are a light sleeper, this could be a problem, with bars open until 2am or later, a fire station right across the street and lots of traffic all day & night.  The king bed had nice linens & the matress was very comfy.  This room had a tub, which I don't think all of their rooms do.  The staff is friendly & helpful.  The Continental breakfast is not much, except for the good granola.  Otherwise, we passed on their breakfast for better options in the Quarter.  Can't beat the location.  We bought a day-pass on the bus/trolley system for $5.  This allowed us to take the Riverfront Trolley to the Canal Street Line to the St. Charles Avenue line...definitely saved us some money.  Parking $15 a day in the Frenchmen's parking courtyard unless you reserve on BookIt, then it's free (although rates may or may not be higher).

You can go online to view the clothes so this review is specifically for the store and team in NOLA.   I've enjoyed going to this store since its opening. I'm always greeted with a welcome as soon as I walk in the door, along with some wonderful tunes playing in the background.   The front of the store is laid out to allow you to view clothes under the natural light from the windows. I appreciate this detail because colors can look COMPLETELY different outside than indoors. Take a few steps up and you'll see an elongated wooden table with complimented benches to display all their seasonal goodies (shirts, jeans, shoes, bow ties, etc). The back of the store houses a BEAUTIFUL bar/register (marble counter?) and a big ol' mirror that worth taking a minutes to observe.   The entire store is covered in unique paintings and portraits as well as fresh floral arrangements . Take a look up while you're shopping to enjoy them.   Side note....ask to check out the kitchen.

3335,Cane and Table,29.960287800000003,-90.0596414,4.0,"Cane and Table represents a trend in bars that has run its course. It may be newish to New Orleans, bartenders taking ten minutes to make a drink to which they add tiny drops of special flavorings, but this has been going on in other cities for quite some time. The general consensus has become that it should never take more than a couple minutes to make a Cuba Libre - even if you have a handlebar mustache and are wearing suspenders while doing it. The two stars here is for the pellet ice that does make up the majority of the cocktail. Good stuff. Didn't try the food and was not impressed by what I saw on the menu. And seriously, a .90 cent additional charge for all drinks made with lime juice because of what is going in in Mexico, that is called the cost of doing business people. When you are already charging $12 a drink, I think you can assume your temporary extra lime cost.",Restaurants

The beer selection is good and they feature many of the local brews. The cocktail menu is definitely unique and ranges from stiff to fruity to sweet.

1325,French Quarter Grill,29.959478000000004,-90.061063,3.5,"I couldn't figure out whether to add this review under Mississippi River Bottoms bar because it's located at the same address.  It's run independently, though; or so I was told.  French Quarter Grill is only reachable by walking through MRB bar and into the courtyard.   According to the gentleman who took my order, FQG is run separately even though it's only accessible via the bar.  Weird.  To further highlight that,  I was told I would need to get my own drink at the bar, pay for it there, and then bring it into the courtyard where I could then give them my food order and pay for it separately.    Aside from being a little confusing for a novice visitor (like me), I like this place.  I liked the bar, too, it was dive-y and down to earth, although I didn't spend any real time in it.  The courtyard is pretty small, shaded in parts, with only a few tables available.   The food is okay, reasonably priced, and served quickly.  The owner's three-legged dog kept me company for a few moments, staring at me while I ate my crawfish, but I was advised not to feed him table scraps as in true dog fashion, he would start sitting at the table with everyone eating outside.  They didn't want him to start that habit.    I enjoyed this place.  I'd definitely come back here in lieu of the nearby busier tourist traps.   French Quarter Grill is a cash only place, so come prepared.",Restaurants

But seriously, y'all, that's enough to give this place 4 stars.   This place is probably equidistance from my house to Big Fisherman, but I usually choose Captain Sal's for my routine boiled crawfish fix (at least once a week, once the season kicks into high gear). Why? Because the crawfish aren't as SALTY as they are at BF, and because the lady who runs the operation at Captain Sal's is ADORABLE and always fishes out the biggest crawfish in the batch to toss into the bag for me. You don't always want to eat the biggest crawfish (good way to break a fingernail, y'all), but the sentiment is nice. :-)  I just realized this review reads as though Brittney Spears had a vocabulary lesson: ""You taste like paaaradise, and I need a vacation tonight!

I went back because stores like this usually get new stuff pretty regularly so my search continues.   They do however have a nice, although very small (just an end cap) of candles, which is one of the few redeeming qualities of this tiny TJ Maxx, probably the smallest TJ's I've ever seen.

I already hauled some major finds from the Oakwood location, so I stopped in here to check out the candle selection. Um...three wick candles for $12?? Yes, please. This is the time of year that I stock up on stuff to give people for Christmas and birthdays. They had all season candles on sale, so I was sure to get a bunch and heads up pumpkin lovers: pumpkin scented everything is priced to move and fall is right around the corner.

First thing Ritz should do is take their name off this restaurant.    Both the service and the food were appalling.    My guest and I arrived at 7:30PM the time of the reservation.  We spoke, momentarily to the host, long enough for him to confirm our reservation and then he picked up a phone call.  He spoke on the phone for about 5 minutes without acknowledging us.  It was long enough for me to find another Ritz employee and explain the situation.  Unfortunately, this employee (a bartender) was not able to help us and went to find another Ritz employee to help us.  By the time the third Ritz employee was involved the Host was off the phone and deigned to show us to our table.  The menu presented to me was soiled (see picture at the following link)  https://plus.google.com/photos/117895691724726875006/albums/5665316290258350801/5838253937848033234?authkey=CLKjte--7pTuWQ  It was disgusting, I have my suspicions as to the source of these unwelcome additions.  The restaurant advertizes themselves as: Ranked as one of the top Farm-to-Table hotel restaurants by Travel + Leisure (January 2011), M bistro's menu is an indigenous approach to the preparation of the finest meats, seafood and produce from farmers throughout the Gulf Region.   I didn't see much evidence of this on the menu, but did select a local salad.  The restaurant was 80% empty but it took quite a while to get our first round of service.    The locally grown salad was completely drenched in dressing.  It was ironic to be in NOLA and have my salad drowned and flooded.  I asked a server to tell the salad chef that the salad was overdressed and her response was ""what?"" I repeated and she said ""OK"".  See a picture of the levy broke salad here:   https://plus.google.com/photos/117895691724726875006/albums/5665316290258350801/5838254027097123522?authkey=CLKjte--7pTuWQ  Next the Chicken.  The presentation was pathetic. One half chicken, split into two parts, and covered with a large quantity of green tasteless fried something (seemed like seaweed) .  The texture of the chicken was profoundly ambiguous, which I found disturbing and unappetizing.    Meantime, my wineglass sat empty so long that I got up and walked back to our host to request a refill.  He also said, ""OK"".  Finally, we were done, and I asked for the check (when wine number 2 was served), and that came pretty quickly.  However, the pickup with the card took so long that it was back to the host for another intervention.    Overall, the most disappointing Ritz experience of my life.",Restaurants

I am  definitely a critic's critic and the type of person which likes to find places that  aren't heavily advertised. I personally believe the food and service of a restaurant  should be  allowed to speak for its self and I must admit a good  happy hour is definitely a bonus.     I was kind of nervous due to the mixed reviews but I had yet to find a thai restaurant which has blown me away and yes I have gone to La Thai,  so i figured I should try and see what this restaurant truly had.  So I went where any curious customer would go and I requested to be sat in the  bar area  and I must say I was not dissappointed.  Their bar area featured the typical stools but also had  an additional  table area  if I preferred. Complete with  a wide selection of import beers and a wine list which showed true care in its creation(I hate seeing kendal jackson on a wine menu or any grocery store brand, lol).   Well back to the experience...I  must give kuddos to the bartender for truly guiding me,  recommendations are one thing but he even had knowledge of specialty items that were not on the menu and unique personal takes on thai staple menu items,(e.g. ""glass noodles in the pad thai for a lighter filling feeling and add pineapple to it if you truly trust me""  plus he  brought  out an amuse bouche).  That is impressive in my eyes and made me feel as if I was the only person that mattered.  Three letters sum up this experience W-O-W.      Anyways,  you are probably wondering about the food and what i ordered.  Well I took this bartenders advice(otherwise why ask,  lol) and ordered these recommendations and I must say he was correct.  So here it goes.... the complimentary amuse bouche was a total shock,  the orange shrimp appetizer was both light and refreshing but wasn't on the menu(so thank you again for guiding me), and  pad thai with glass noodles and pineapple must receive two thumbs up due to creativity and flavor). I am not quite sure why people are saying this place is overpriced or that the food service is below par.  In regards to price it is  definitely on par with the other thai restaurants,  maybe its just the LA style decor which intimidates  them  but i personally loved the decor.  Anyways I hope this review helps somebody.  All i can say about this place in closing is I personally only write on yelp if i have a disappointing experience or an above expectations one and yelpers this one was definitely above my expectations.",Restaurants

2081,Uptown Sports Bar and Grill,29.926071000000004,-90.094031,2.0,"Ugh...where to begin. Okay, our bartender Kim was GREAT!!! So apparently it's pretty new, she said they hadn't been open too long. Maybe that's the reasons behind the experience...maybe not.   1. The menu is too extensive, I feel like they need to condense it and narrow down the options. There's wings, burgers, pizza, riblets, AHI TUNA even...too much. It took me forever to decide on what to actually eat.   2. There are NO drink menus so you don't know what the beer or alcohol costs. Which would've been extremely helpful for me. I drink Jack Daniels but honestly $7 for a 6 ounce cup is NOT appealing. However, i didn't know i was paying $7 for a 6 ounce cup until I got my check. And I didn't know I was paying $6 for a Sweetwater Blue (which is also a cit overpriced, I'm used to about $3.50/$4.50).   3. The wing sauces are NOT premade before the shift. There were some sauces we wanted to test first before ordering the wings and apparently the cook in the kitchen has to make the sauce when there's an order for wings. So asking for a taste took about 10 minutes. THEN, apparently you have to PAY FOR A TASTE! Because the taste is the WINGS!!!! Like my husband & I had 5 wings land in front of us. 3 wings for the sauce i was tasting and 2 for him. ODD RIGHT?!?!? Yeah, I knew I wasn't the only one to think so. So it kinda ruined my appetite because I ordered a 5-piece wings and was full after 2 because of the taste test. It seems like that's actually giving food away ya know.   4. My total was $53.60 after taxes. Yes, for 2 people at a sports bar I paid $53.60 and we essentially got 2-5 piece wings ($5.75/each), side of fries ($3.50), 4- 6 ounce drinks ($28) and a beer ($6). So after tip I paid almost $70 AT A SPORTS BAR!!!!!!!!!!!   Like I said, service from the bartender was great!! She was friendly and highly attentive.

Those who have criticized this museum for being disorganized and expensive are missing a critical point: it's pretty much a grassroots, ""mom and pop"" style Museum. The preservation of Southern culinary history is a pretty cool endeavour, and the CONCEPT of the museum is solid. Displays feature the regional characteristics and culture of various foods and beverages, and the cocktail museum provides a visual timeline of cocktail culture.   The museum, overall, is unique and a visual riot of the tastes, tools, and techniques that bring us Southern cuisine. We began our tour with a stop at the bar in the adjoining restaurant, marveling at an impromptu course in bitters by the very well-versed bartender. The bar itself was brought, in pieces, to the Museum and rebuilt. It was originally built in 1851, I believe.  The tour of the rest of the museum was an eclectic lovefest of the various States of Taste, with exhibits focused on the characteristics of each region's cuisine. The current exhibit was Photography of Modernist Cuisine, which was very striking (the site's ""Exhibits"" page has past exhibits for more info).   Our target, though, was La Galerie d'Absinthe, a private collection not yet fully set up in the museum. Still, we clambered into the back corner to look at the collection and history of Absinthe. That corner morphed into an exhibit featuring ""still life"" of an absinthe house, and the accoutrements of absinthe were fascinating!   The Absinthe exhibit merged with the Museum of the American Cocktail, which was a wall of spirits presented as a timeline of sorts.   Overall, we learned a lot about the evolution of many forms of BBQ and spirits, and definitely intend on returning when we are once again in New Orleans!",Shopping

I was impressed. 5) This place might be a high 2 star or a low 3 except that they were open and functioning well post-hurricane when everyone else was closed.  Outstanding!  Reasons to avoid: 1) Ca$h only! ATM is on sight.  This sucks because I never carry cash...ever.  So it's an extra $2.50 (im guessing at the ATM fee here) to pull out $20 and pay for a $9 dollar meal.  This is the definition of 'hassle' 2) Small town feel.  From the 80's wood paneling that echoes single-wides of yesteryear to the attitude of the staff ringing ""Didja bring that rain with ya?"", this place exudes small town.  This is a big negative for me.  Small town hates outsiders but tolerate you when you have a descent attitude and pay without asking stupid questions about the menu items, or when they plan on accepting credit cards or if they have a gold member's club that allows free fricken refills.    3) No stinking drink refills.  If you want to piss this guy off, have him pay $2 for a stinking fountain drink and not allow refills.  Ugh.  *Neutral note:  The first time I visited the tables weren't wiped down and set up the second and third times they were.  The place seemed orderly and halfway clean 2/3 of the time.",Restaurants

No cover when we went. The band playing was called Sugar Funk and they had 1 or 2 original songs and sang covers of funk/jazz/r&b songs the rest of the set. They were entertaining and upbeat. All the singers in this group are amazing and so is the band. I was definitely grooving along with the music during their whole hour or so set. Some people were even dancing. My sister ordered a Sazerac from the bar (had to since it was our first time in New Orleans) and it was good and licorice-y but a little sweet for our taste. But in the drink's defense, we don't like sugary drinks in general and the bartender was really good about dialing down the sweetness for us so I think on the whole it was not a sweeter Sazerac. Great place to come and chill and listen to some good local musicians.",Nightlife

You place your order at the kitchen and wait for your name to be called. That's my favorite time, where you stand back and choose from the 100+ options of soft drinks and beverages from the coolers lining the long wall. After a short while, your name is called and --whew man!-- the food is exactly what you were looking for. I tried most of everything over the years and the Maple Feast is my usual option. The french fry po boy is also a good choice as well.  Favori is good for a quick bite, better if you're hungover.

We were disappointed and forced to go downtown Bourbon Street and the French Quarters in the rain FML!  Unlike here in SF, the rain does not let up in New Orleans, it rains continuously causing flood zones; hence Katrina.  I give credit to the bar staff for doing a good job during happy hour to ensure my son had the biggest root beer float, which made his day.

I had the Legitimate Business Man cocktail (made with Old Forester 1897 whiskey!) and as far as I know unique to this establishment.  It was strong and smooth, and a steal at only $6.  They have other drinks too which are equally well valued.    I also had the Turtle soup, which I've always wanted to try.  It's a New Orleans staple, and served at quite a few places around town. At $6, it was a great time to try.  They even mix sherry in front of you, which is a nice touch.  It was excellent and would order again.    Really great place and seems more casual than most Brennan places, but that might be because I was there for Happy Hour and sat at the bar.  Also being on Decatur has more of a festive attitude.

To begin this is not a review on the restaurant end, I've always enjoyed the brunch and have always left satisfied with what I've ordered and the service has always been great. This concerns more with the bar side and the outrageous $20 cover to enter the pool only to leave minutes later because the amount of people was the equivalent to all the people you see in a wave pool at a water park and god knows what's going on beneath the surface.   I have never seen such a lack of urgency with the bartenders both in the front and in the pool area as was displayed today. I understand what it means to be in the weeds but when your staff is dragging or in their case dancing and having casual conversations with other patrons while there are other people waiting to be served and showing no recognition of how long one individual has been waiting there to order vs. someone who just walked up is frustrating as a customer who was just looking to relax. Staffing wasn't the issue, there was more than enough bartenders to handle the crowds both in front and in the back bar. The issue was bartenders who showed zero lack of customer awareness and were rude to customers when voicing their displeasure at the amount if time they've had to wait.   I have always enjoyed the Country Club and have often recommended it to people who want to try something different while visiting out here.

Upon arriving, they escort you upstairs and give you (strong) cucumber water to sip on while you fill out some forms and wait.

The forms asked your standard questions about basic info, allergies, etc but then there were the weird ones that I didn't feel they needed to know for a massage - but I told myself, maybe the forms were standard for all services to keep it simple for them.   I *think* my lady's name was Michelle - don't hold me to that though. We moved to the room where she told me to change and lie on the warm bed and get situated. She began on the front then worked her to my back and then my scalp - which I didn't know was included and was rather intense. The hot towel wrap was a nice addition to her completing her services, however.  Now - there was a question on the form asking if I (or anyone filling out the form for that matter) bruised easily - kind of an odd question but I said no because to my knowledge - no, I don't just bruise randomly.   But then... two days later, I woke up and notice what I didn't initially think was a bruise all over the front of shoulder, was a huge bruise... it stuck around for about 4 days following my massage and just wasn't a cute look. I know Michelle said I was the tensest she had seen in months BUT I didn't think that meant she pushed on my muscles so hard I would bruise! Ouch!

This place has two main sections, a larger main floor where the big names play, and a side section about 35% smaller with couches.   The side section has a really strange sound setup. Also one of the DJs playing there messed up a few times when I was there - not cool  There is not a lot of room in the main section, and it's hard to move around... really packed, you can't move in any direction at all. The location of the men's bathroom forces you to cut through all the seating booths along one side of the main room... kind of annoying  The whole thing does stay open really late, which is cool, and the side section usually has more room to wander. There is also a ""hallway"" that you walk through to get in which is outdoors, and you can hang out there and chat or cool off.  Location is kind of random.

They are all very nice and friendly and it's great to get to know people that are really trying to change their lives.   The prices are pretty good, but be sure to negotiate! You don't even need to haggle. Usually if you ask them the price, Jacques (I think the manager, or at least the guy who does all the pricing), will look at it, cut it to half the given price, and then say, ""But I'll give it to you for half that."" My friends got a couch for $100 marked $300, and I bought an antique mirror for $20, that was originally marked $80.

I had the vegetarian adobo.  It was spot on. It tasted like my mom's cooking but without the pork or chicken. They instead used a textured soy. I finished up with halo halo.

Cornbread was extra at 75 cents. Everything was delicious except the fried oysters. The batter used for the oysters was different than that used for the catfish. The oyster was more battered versus breaded. If the batter for the oysters was the same as the catfish, they probably would have tasted great.

If you do, you need to rent from these guys.  We had decided to rent bikes pretty early on and had already stopped by a few bike rental/tour companies to check on pricing and quality of the bikes.  When we found these guys it was a no brainer to go with them.   1. Great prices : $25 for three hours, $30 for 8 hours, and $35 for a 24 hour period.  We went with the 24 hour rental which was perfect since we never felt rushed and had plenty of time to see the whole city. The also have after hour returns so you can or pretty much return the bikes whenever you want.  Tip: when we were there they had a check in offer for 10% off. Good way to save a couple bucks.  2. Great bikes: all the bikes seemed brand new (plus made in America) and were very well taken care of and super comfortable. They are pretty large cruisers that would be bad if there were any hills in the city but are perfect for the super flat city of New Orleans. They also have super cushiony seats and some have baskets perfect for carrying purses and other things.   Tip: the men's bicycle seats are way more comfortable that the women's. They don't have baskets on them but, if you are a girl, it may be worth going with a guys bike for the better seats. Some of the roads are pretty bumpy.  3. Great service: Teddy,  the office manager and tour guide, was super helpful and took his time to map out all the major attractions, the roads we should take, the areas we should avoid, and plenty of recommendations of great restaurants.   His knowledge was invaluable and saved us a lot of time. It was also nice basically having a tour route mapped out for you.  He was also just a super nice guy.

They denied him. He peacefully asked why won't you let me in and and they kept saying bc it's a private business and we have the right not to let you in. We kept arguing with them and they kept giving us the same reasoning behind not letting my buddy in. Then I tried to record the security guard and the door man denying my friend's entry. The security guard threatened to call the cops. At this point I have no idea as to why he would think the cops needed to be called. Then the security guard walked to f and ms and we thought he was trying to tell the people at f and ms not to let us in. F and ms let us in bc they have great workers who actually know how to check an ID. Moral of the story is that for some unknown reason Gritz decided not to let my legal friend into their bar, but most importantly the doorman and security guard were being assholes. The security guard has a huge ego and believes he has the same authority as an actual cop. I love f and ms and I appreciate its ability to respectfully accept all people into its bar that are over  21. But Gritz is a whole different story. I witnessed Gritz disrespect one of my best friends in a way that no one should be disrespected. I am still confused as to why this bar denied entry to my legal friend.

Also, Chad Smith of the Red Hot Chili Peppers was dining at the table next to us, so that was pretty cool...  Unfortunately, despite all that we liked about Tommy's, the food was beyond bad.  We had the special- avocado crab salad to start. Mustard, crab and avocado just really don't pair very well and the crab didn't taste fresh at all. Then we had the oysters Rockefeller which, honestly, I found inedible. Though I will say, the large size of the dish is really unbelievable for the price you pay ($10). The oysters were gigantic (I'm sure some people will love this, but I found them to be pretty gross) with some green pur√©e on top of them which had both an unpleasant taste and texture. For our entree, we shared the shrimp linguine. It wasn't bad, but was just kind of bland and boring and definitely not a $22 dish.

194,Magazine Antique Mall,29.9248982,-90.0851834,19.0,"I really don't bother with negative reviews, but this time an exception has to be made.  I'd like to follow up on Elsa H.'s review of this place, since I was a member of the family being threatened with police action over trying to purchase a lamp.  I've visited this store many times (it's only a few blocks from our house--we live in the Garden District / Irish Channel), and have had no small share of weird or rude encounters.  Previously, it was decidedly unfriendly looks from the staff, noting encounters with patrons who wanted to keep their purses rather than surrender them at the front counter, etc.  I continued to visit, however, because there's a certain sort of eclectic ""junk pile"" vibe here and some genuinely interesting stuff. This time, the epic unfriendliness of the staff was directed squarely at us, however.  One detail omitted from the previous description of this encounter is when Elsa tried to diffuse the situation with the female owner, the husband (?), rather than trying to also diffuse the situation and (perhaps?) sell something, immediately not only made the ""tell the police to hurry up"" remark  but also tried to throw additional and unrelated fuel on the fire, and blame the kids for breaking things.  Since they were picking vintage comic books for purchase with me, in a different area of the store, and the lamp was on a high shelf elsewhere, that's a little hard to digest.  I'd also like to reinforce how nice it was to have other patrons who were also going to buy things simply leave the store and follow us next door to La Davina (highly recommended gelato) to discuss what happened.  If you're visiting New Orleans and looking for antiques, I strongly encourage you to check out the other offerings on Magazine St.  If you're a local, I think it's obvious that except possibly as an anti-gentrification move, we really don't want a visitor's experience on the otherwise fantastic Magazine St. stretch to include this sort of abuse.  And finally, if you're considering consigning your merchandise to be sold by this store, I encourage you to first be an observant ""customer"", and decide if you believe anything will actually be sold at all, given the attitude of the owners.  There are better choices.   Please don't support this horrible store.  And in summary, it's unfortunate that Yelp doesn't allow zero-star reviews.",Shopping

We have been a few times and the food is solid and changes seasonally which is great.  I was disappointed that after choosing this oyster happy hour over several others in the city we were told we had to sit at the bar (we brought our 10 yr old foodie so not an option) in order to have the happy hour prices. The restaurants website did not specify happy hour at the bar neither did Nola eater (other restaurants do specify this as part of their happy hour).  We intended on dining from the menu and not just the happy hour oyster menu which we did so it would have been nice to be extended the oyster happy hour price.  That said we ordered the pig ears which were super crispy and seasoned well, the drum throat which was super flaky and tender but did need a bit more seasoning for my taste, the gumbo which was delicious and the boudin stuffed wild boars heart which was tender and flavorful.  We also ordered from the beer and wine menu and happy with the selections.  Our 10 yr old ordered a great mocktail (tasted like a mojito minus the rum).  Our waiter was very nice and humorous as well as informative as to upcoming beer and wine dinners.  By the way there were only 4 tables at the time (we arrived at 5:45pm) so I would think after my husband asked about the happy hour upon arrival perhaps the manager would have had made a point to notice our check of over $200 and made a point to give us that happy hour special for the oysters.

The leather on the back was all warped and stretched out and was separating from the alligator skin.  The holes were all stretched out from me getting fatter as I got older.  The loop had fallen off.  I took it to Bayou Belts to see if it could be repaired.  The owner told me that he could take it apart, clip the leather and reshape it, fix the loop and clean it but it wouldn't be perfect because there was so much wear on it.  He also said it would be fairly expensive.  I'm looking around at his store and he's got belts starting at about $500, so I'm thinking I'd be willing to spend about $150 to get this one decent looking.  He calculates the cost and it's like $25.  Of course I tell him to go ahead with the repair.  A few days later he calls me up to let me know that it's finished.  I'm not expecting that much, not for $25.  I get there and the belt looks almost brand new.  It feels and smells brand new.  The alligator skin is polished and looking great!  The leather on the back is flawless.  I can't believe how incredible it looks for only $25 worth of repair.  If your belt is looking janky, I can't recommend this place enough!",Shopping

It had recently been redone in a mint green with a distressed look and I loved how perfect they restored it. What's even more awesome is that I saw another dresser that I liked the framework but was hoping for another with a distressed look in a more natural tone. I asked if I could pay more for one of the men to prime, paint, and gloss it. I was just told to go to a hardware store to buy the paint color (s) I wanted and he could have it done within a week.

From the look of him, he earned it, working long past retirement age. I admit that I wish he would have sold the small business and kept it going in that way. De Blanc delivered drugs to the doorsteps of Bayou St. John for several decades and will be missed. New Orleans landscape would not be the same and its flavor would diminish significantly if we found only Walgreen's on every corner.

861,Zasu,29.975336600000002,-90.10028,1.0,"I predict Zasu will be the best new restaurant of 2019. Zasu has only been open for two weeks and already the food can be described as no less than stunning. Chef Sue is knocking it out of the park - she is back with a vengeance! Run, don't walk, to this phenomenal new gem in mid-city.   We attended as a party of 8 and therefore tried most of the appetizers. I do not consider myself to be someone who normally likes octopus, but the baby octopus appetizer will make a convert out of the most reluctant. If you like octopus, this may become your absolute favorite octopus dish in the city...or anywhere. The murder point oysters with Meyer lemon granita are light, delicious, and salty fresh from the sea.  The goat cheese agnolotti is served with homemade potato chips on top; the contrast in texture and saltiness of the chip/sweetness of the cheese, is sublime. The grilled lobster curry is as good as it sounds, and the portion is very generous. The wagyu carpaccio - is healthy and super delicious.  The final appetizer we tried was an Asian fried veal rib with scallion egg fried rice - fantastic and not to be missed.  As for entrees, there are three fish dishes: halibut, snapper and flounder. You really can't go wrong with any of these dishes. All three are outstanding. There are also pierogis, which are so good a carnivore won't miss the meat, and a really beautiful and contemporary version of beef bourguignon.  Someone at our table had chicken and loved it - I would not ever order chicken while eating out so I did not waste any room in my stomach on that dish.  For dessert, we tried the chocolate pot du creme, which had cocoa nibs, sea salt and whipped cream - this is rich and wonderful if you are a chocolate lover. The apple-cranberry crisp with bourbon ice cream was my husband's favorite, and it is a winner. . The decor is modern, warm and inviting, an enormous transformation from those who remember Rue 127 (I liked Rue 127, you just will not recognize the place).

Admittedly, we haven't found a lot of good Mexican restaurants in Uptown.  Go figure.    We order mostly the fish tacos which are respectable.  In fact, it's the only taco that we have liked from Taqueria Corona.  The carne asada is pretty pathetic.  The tortilla is decent, so they are halfway there.  But the meat is dry and not well seasoned.  So the saving grace of TC is their fish tacos.  My cousin who recommended the place told me not to waste my time with anything but the fish tacos.  He's an idiot, so of course I ordered other stuff.  Turns out he is a genius.  Only the fish tacos are good. And they are just good, not killer.  They have a respectable few thick pieces of unknown fish lightly battered and served under a spicy tarter sauce.  I'd rate them a 3.5/5.    The people are nice and food is reasonably priced.  Stick with the fish tacos and you should have a very decent meal.",Restaurants

I turned my vehicle around and decided to investigate this new business. I pulled in to the parking lot and checked it out. Sure enough my eyes did not deceive me there was a new business sign in front of the place. Making extra sure of the new changes I went inside.  The first new change I noticed was the bartender. A very pretty red head who had an incredibly positive disposition. I spoke with her about her business. She informed me of the new changes, Namely the change in management which I was very ecstatic about.  The next changes she informed me about were the menu. I took a look and placed an order. I ordered their signature ""Recovery Room"" burger. It is a mixture of beef and hot sausage which gives it an extra kick. I made sure my burger was dressed with all the fixin's and topped with pepper jack cheese which gave it a little extra spice! I substituted their fries for some onion rings. The burger was fantastic, and it was so big that I actually could not finish it. The onion rings were good too, they were nice and crispy just the way I like it. They also came with some spicy dipping sauce. My hats off to the blonde lady in the kitchen, she did a good job cooking my meal.  This is the 4th bar and grill that has been here in this very location. I don't know if some Voodoo witch doctor put a curse on this location but the last 3 businesses had some bad luck here. I told the bartender the same thing that I told the last 2 business owners,""You got a good thing going here don't screw it up"". I just hope she listens to my advice because I would really hate to see these guys go out of business. Still this place is a work in progress and I will be stopping buy every once in a while to see how things are going.  This place has a full bar and quiet a variety of beers .

This place is super cute and has a very eclectic charm to it. They repurpose everything and even use tin cans to give you your bill. I had the fish tacos and Blondie for dessert. The Fish Tacos were amazing, the fish was super fresh and the toppings had a beautiful light zesty and savory flavor. The flavors were very well balanced and even the sides were amazing. It came with some savory beans, cajunish rice, pickled slaw and guacamole. The fish was very fresh, no pungent smell or taste, flaky and beautifully seasoned. The Blondie was heaven, it wasn't overtly sweet and the icecream was velvety. My friend had the Molly Ringwald cocktail and it was just refreshing (I had a taste of course). I usually don't like rose flavors, but this was downright pleasant! Do yourself a favor and head on down here, but beware, like all hole in the wall places, parking is a disaster.",Restaurants

Got to love a wing place with about 10 tables and bulletproof glass you have to order through. All transactions go through a box on the window where both sides can't be open at the same time. Somehow, these are the kind of places that have some of the best food. And Wing Snack Express definitely falls in that category. I read through some of the reviews that said the service was rude. But the lady that took our order was as nice and helpful as could be. So no complaints there.  I ordered the roasted garlic wings and split an order of ranch fries. The fries were definitely cooked from frozen... but still had a great flavor. The wings were really good. Up there with some of the best I have had. Unfortunately, they did forget to put some of the sauce in that someone in our group ordered with plain wings. And that apparently is not the 1st or 2nd time that has happened. We will know to double check in the future. A quick offer on our way out to earn $20 to give a guy a ride home, and my first experience was complete.",Restaurants

The food came out quick and it was fantastic! The fish was fresh and the bowl was huge. I especially liked that it had just enough rice, but not too much, like other poke bowls.   The owner was friendly throughout the meal and the atmosphere is cool and laid back. As a consumer, if I had one suggestion it would be this- the menu is really big; there's breakfast, sandwiches, poke, sushi, salads, a ton of sides and spam. I would pare it down a bit and maybe stick to sushi, poke and spam- I don't think you need to offer a ton of sandwiches, salads and sides. I would say offer maybe one or two signature sandwiches, one or two salads and let the rest be sushi, poke and spam (to stick with the Aloha theme).

Overall this is not a bad store, they always greet you when you walk in 'welcome to CVS' but I think this is a company policy not something that is store specific.   Something I like about this place (and CVS in general) is the coupons they give you on your receipts and how you can earn points for purchases over time that can be converted in to 'cash' by reducing your total when you decide to use your points.   One final note is that if you come in the morning right after they open there will be carts and boxes covered in cling wrap full of merchandise everywhere, some stacked almost to the ceiling. I don't know if I'm just lucky and have gone there early several times on whatever day they get their deliveries but it seems like they could be a little more organized. I've seen boxes and random trash everywhere etc. I know they have to do what they have to do and that the merchandise does not just magically replenish itself but to me how they go about making that happen just seems messy and lazy.

3341,Palm Room Diamond Lounge At Harrahs,29.949609106,-90.0646672017,1.0,"The Diamond lounge at Harrah's New Orleans is not labeled as such and it is not the easiest place to find.  It is actually called the Palm Room and it is located in the back of the high limit tables area.  It could easily be mistaken for a lounge where high limit gaming goes on.  I have been to the casino four different times and this was actually my first time stopping at the lounge since it never really stood out before.  Plus there really isn't a need to go to the lounge which is what makes it unique.  But, before I get to that I will give you a quick rundown of the lounge's offering.  The set up inside is on the smaller side and when I stopped in there on Sunday evening it was pretty full.  The room has dark wood throughout and a small bar area with a few seats.  Most of the seating is at regular tables though.  There was a small buffet with a decent selection of hot items, although I think they sometimes have a small menu to order off of.  The buffet had chicken noodle soup, potato salad, pulled pork, baked beans, dinner rolls, and an assortment of cookies.  It was a better spread than you see in the Las Vegas lounges most of the time.  Drink policy!!!  The drink policy is what sets Harrah's New Orleans apart from the other Total Rewards locations, and it is an improvement in my opinion.  When you are at the lounge you are told that you are limited to 4 drinks per day as a Diamond member. Seven Stars members are limited to 8 drinks per day.  That sounds punitive since Las Vegas and Atlantic City give you unlimited drinks in the lounge everyday.  What makes this policy unique is that you can get those 4 drinks at pretty much any bar in the casino. That includes the awesome steakhouse!  You are limited to drinks $15 and under. That is up to $60 in value per day for Diamond card holders, $120 for Seven Star card holders.  This lounge is great!! I recommend it highly if your visiting!!!",Restaurants

He was very personable and we really enjoyed talking with him. Unbeknownst to me, my man was planning on proposing while we were on our vacation, but didn't have a ring yet. While looking through the case of antique jewelry I saw the most beautiful ring I've ever laid eyes on. A 1 carat canary yellow diamond with 58 little white diamonds, all arranged and crafted beautifully. I was in love, but thought I would never be able to own such a beautiful and expensive piece of jewelry, plus I had no idea that I would soon be receiving a proposal. My man was paying close attention to my reaction of that ring. When he proposed later that evening he told me that he wanted it to be mine. When we went back to Naghi's, Biggie was great about bartering on the price and accepting a down-payment to hold the ring for a month.

I reserve this for my last-ditch alcohol efforts, after I comb through Rouses and Williams for my fancy-pants bottles of quality booze.   To wit: I had a limited Christmas budget, but I didn't want my gifts to look cheap to the untrained eye. Off to Martin's we go! I looked confused, and a staffer stepped up within seconds. Whoohoo! I had $25 in my pocket to make my brother think he was getting a ""very ritzy"" Christmas gift, and the staffer understood. He pointed to several bottles with good pedigree that fit my budget, explaining the relative merits of each in a nutshell. I had his full attention, and he managed to solve my problem in less than 3 minutes. Quality of help trumps quantity.   But it's not just about Christmas gifts and ritzy bottles. I've lugged home several bottles of wine that cost less than $10 and brought the thunder. (Miss you, Gary V.) Each display was marked with reviews and helpful signs, letting me know that the staff had tasted and approved. Martin's just doesn't specialize in blank looks and confessions that they only drink vodka. If a staffer doesn't know about the wine or beer you are looking at, they can point to the person who does.   Did I mention beer? Martin's has beer. They have lots of weird beers, wild beers, unique beers, far-flung beers. They sell by the bottle, with mixy-sixies available as well. Their super chiller (marked for wine) will also make your beer frosty in the time it takes to do a lap around the store so you can walk down Magazine Street with a tasty brew in-hand.   I have not mentioned cheese, but I will. Martin's has fancy cheese. If you buy all of it, I will be grumpy because runny cheese is my secret lover. Do I need to sell anyone on the merits of good cheese? No, didn't think so. If you want the cheese, turn right upon entry.   So Martin's = wine. Martin's = beer. Martin's = cheese. Martin's = liquor and spirits. Martin's = good stuff.   Accessibility notes: Door opens in. Bottles are stacked floor to ceiling so seated customers may require assistance. High counters.

My friends and I had the Seoul Man chicken, the Brisket, and the Hermit. All the meats were so juicy and flavorful, and the on-top combinations are awesome. Great kick, and they line the bottom of the trays with jalapenos for a little extra spice. You get two good sized tacos per order for 6-7$. I had one order and felt satisfied, and I took one to go.

But when the staff assume (ASSUME) that the customer knows everything and they act that they know everything then how in the hell can anything be done correctly. Seriously...I don't claim that ""the customer is always right"" motto hold true every time but when you know they clearly made numerous errors and then blame the customer and not take responsibility for it..there's a problem. I would've given it a 1 star but they did do the work...eventually.   This is the issue: We go in the store requesting a set of longer keys be made from really short original. The doesn't really listen to what we're were requesting and grabs the key and says it'll be done by Monday (it's Friday now). He doesn't write down the order request nor anything else. He said he'll call when it's done. We call Wednesday, 2 days after it was to be ready and he said that it'll be some more time since it needs to be sent out. He'll call...it'll be a couple more days Wed or Thurs. we waited to Friday and he didn't call so we call. He said angrily over the phone ""I said I'll call you!"" We asked that you said it'll take a few days to make the keys. He said that's not what you ordered. You asked to make the same keys that you had. We said no we wanted the long keys. He said we you didn't say anything when I said I had order the keys. You should've said something. He completely blamed me and thinks I I should know what I need to order when they know what they do and what they make. Really to get mad at me when I don't know what they're doing. The guy claims to take pride in his work and effort but not man enough to admit he made an error instead blame the customer.   So then my husband calls to see what's the issue and claims that we didn't clarify what we wanted. He said the keys will be done soon in a couple hours. He then calls my husband back, not me to tell him the keys are ready.   I go the next day and find that 2 brass keys are made and it'll be $43. My wife says wow...that's a lot could the keys have been made out of a more affordable metal?? The other worker said well what you don't want it ok. Oh yeah your the customer who complained about the keys the other day and made a big deal. Now all of a sudden we have the workers against the customer. The 2nd helper then says well do you want the brass keys or not? My wife says well I need them now as my workers need to test the hardware that was installed. She asked why it's so expensive and why brass was used. The guy said ""well the piece you turned in was brass so we made it brass. You didn't say a different metal"". She said what you can make it out of A cheaper metal? He said ""yes"". Wife said why didn't you tell me my options. The guy said ""you should know"". What!?!?  Yeah they can do the work and there are many if any Other places to get your work done but wow how pompous are they!?!? Really customer service?   Update:: now we have the keys and they don't fit.  For $40 for 2 keys and they don't fit. Now we have to go all the way across town to get it fixed. Any you know what?? They will blame us.   If the first Rault was alive I bet he would fire them!

3110,Restaurant August,29.95,-90.0668309,3.0,"So on our last night in New Orleans we really wanted an awesome meal.   We had eaten at some of the typical NOLA classics like Galatoire's and Antoine's. But we wanted something a little less ""classic"" and a little more...new? trendy? high-end? I think we wanted something a little more ""New York"". We were at the Hotel Monteleone having afternoon cocktails and asked our waitress her recommendations. She said Restaurant August, without a doubt. I had heard of it and a colleague back home who is from New Orleans had recommended it, but because it wasn't one of the tried and true NOLA classics, I didn't pay much attention.  Obviously I opened my Yelp app and checked it out. Solid reviews, people raving about the food, service, atmosphere. A few photos of the food and interior confirmed that it was, indeed, what we were looking for.   I made a reservation and all they had left was 9PM. No problemo, we are New Yorkers, after all, we are used to eating mad late.   We walked over from our hotel on Bourbon Street to the restaurant. It was in what I suppose you would call the business part of town. Much quieter than Bourbon Street, people dressed nicer, ect.   We walked in and were seated immediately. The space is beautiful. The enormous vintage style crystal chandeliers, wood paneled walls, everything was high end and a lot of thought went into it. It was exactly the sort of more modern and trendy version of what those old New Orleans restaurants looked like inside.   Our server came over immediately to take our drink order. Because I am a complete and total sucker for martinis, I went with that. They were not even close to disappointing. I was swooning over them in minutes.   The menu was awesome, we had such a hard time choosing what to have. The waiter was very helpful with this. He asked us what jumped out at us and then went through the composition, cooking method and ingredients in each dish and why he thought they were special. It was incredible to hear about the preparation, each dish had a special twist to it, making it far and away different than that same dish at another restaurant.   We decided to share appetizers. First, we ordered the Foie Gras prepared three ways. Three small portions of foie gras (which is one of my favorite things) all cold or slightly warmed, each composing their own little dish, completely different from each other, yet tying together nicely. We also had the handmade potato gnocchi, tossed with blue crab and black truffle. It was some of the most perfect gnocchi I have ever had. Substantial, but still light and fluffy. The sauce mixed with the crab and truffles...divine.   Another round of martinis later, and I was all jazzed up for our entrees.   But first! An amuse bouche. A half quail egg shell stuffed with a Parmesan mousse and topped with an avocado custard...sounds weird, it was amazing and decadent.   For my main, I ordered the Chappapeela Farms Duckling, with silver queen corn, buttered radish and blackened foie gras. It was SO GOOD. I have recently discovered that I enjoy duck and August did it right. slightly crispy skin, tender meat, the sauces perfectly complimenting the duck, and enough foie gras to have some with each bite of duck. Really, an incredible dish.   When they offered us dessert, I was a little hesitant because I was so, so full already. But once again, our waiter went through how each dessert is composed and what ingredients are used, so once again we were pumped and all ordered a dish.   I had the Banana Pudding and OHMYGODDDDDD. You best book your tickets to NOLA for this dish alone. It came with peanut butter, marshmallow and nila wafer ice cream. I was legit licking my plate clean at the end. Everyone at the table said it was amazing.   I want more! Help!  All throughout the meal the waiter was attentive and friendly, informative and we never wanted for anything. I was sad to go at the end, but so pleased we took the chance on something in the business district.

It was light, flaky and buttery. I will be back for the baked goods and will try the desserts.  I will not be back for lunch. The lunch menu was very small with virtually no descriptions, and I was unclear as to if they were still serving breakfast options when I went for a late lunch. I decided to order a caesar salad after I asked what was on the farm salad and the lone counter server had a difficult time answering such a routine question. He said it was ""just stuff from the garden down the street"" and mentioned carrots, beets and watermelon. The boy was nice, but to be honest he was not very helpful.  The caesar salad was nothing special, and it wasn't even made in house. I watched the chef bring it in from College Inn across the parking lot. He handed it right to me after walking through the front door. I hope that was an aberration. There's no reason not to prepare things fresh on site.

Here, I like the chicken just as much as the beef. The chicken appears to be/is all white meat.  The Beef is brisket and meatballs.   The Spring Rolls have earned the 5 stars. I know, i know, I'm probably overdoing it with this rating, but hear me out.  The spring rolls have a delicious amount of plump shrimp (none of that butterflied crap), pork, and plenty of mint.

We were really excited after checking out the menu and reading the reviews. Wow, did we end up disappointed.   I'll started with the good: The food is good. It's interesting, unique and tasty. My blue cheese gnocchi was unlike anything I've ever had before. The mussels and the greens were also yummy.  The bad: We were seated at 8:30 for an 8pm reservation. What's the point of taking reservations if you can't honor them?  We were starving when sat down, and still very excited. But then things got worse. The service was slooooooowwwwww. The server paid us little attention, took forever to get our orders and drinks, and there was teeny tiny dribble of food coming out of the kitchen for the entire restaurant.   At 9:45, we'd had one round of drinks and appetizers served to us. Yeah, I don't think that's acceptable. It was after 10pm when we got our main dishes.  The portions on half of our dishes was SMALL for what we paid. Two in our party were still HUNGRY after leaving the restaurant. If I pay $30-$35 per person for dinner, I shouldn't still be hungry.  There was never one word of acknowledgement about the slow pace of food service, or any effort to provide some kind of complimentary dish while we waited. That's distasteful, to say the least.  I was bummed because this was our one ""fancier"" night out while we were in town. Maybe it's better during the week, but was not worth going to on the weekend.",Restaurants

We ordered the popcorn catfish appetizer, I ordered a breakfast po boy with bacon and the eggs over easy and my girlfriend ordered the St. Ann benedict. I had a coffee and my girlfriend had the French quarter coffee (coffee with Baileys, Kahlua and whipped cream).   The coffee was fine, aside from the fact that there was no regular sugar on our table or the tables around ours. The French quarter coffee was incredible, much better than a normal ""Irish coffee.""  The popcorn catfish tasted good and wasn't overly battered. However, the menu said that it came with a ""variety of sauces."" In this case a variety meant ""more than one"" as it came out with only tartar sauce and a (wonderful) cocktail sauce.   The po boy was an awful abomination of a breakfast sandwich. The bread was awful, it was slathered in mayonnaise (mayo for breakfast - no thanks, ever). I know that po boys are typically dressed in mayo but the menu made no mention of this.   The St. Ann benedict was equally terrible. Lacked any recognizable flavor. The toast was not run through a toaster, or if it was, it wasn't in there long enough to make the transition from bread to toast. And the pathetic four forkfuls of breakfast potatoes came out cold.

Let me start by saying the salesman was very nice and helpful through the process especially with the many revisions we had and are happy with the quality of our purchase. But understand that once you have purchased your cabinets from campbell and possibly other cabinet only suppliers, it is your responsibility to install them yourself or obtain the services of a contractor to install them (something we we not told till time to seal the deal) and if you are spending say $30,000 and up on cabinets with lots of detail you will need to have an experienced installer do the job. This is where the quandary is. If you are buying from a big box store or any supplier that provides installation, they will provide you with a contractor (at a cost up front at the time of purchase i'm guessing) and If there is a problem with installation such as missing, incorrect parts, or ill fitting cabinets they will confer with the store or supplier to correct the problem or if you are unhappy later with a problem you have discovered, the store or supplier will assume the responsibility to correct it even if the problem was the contractors fault.  If you purchase cabinets at one place then hire someone on your own to do the install and then run into a problem of one blaming the other, leaving you to referee the deal and later on if a problem arises good luck having one or the other take responsibility. It's like ordering a automobile in parts and either the factory assembles it or you hire a mechanic to put it together. In our case sometimes the contractor contacted campbell's but sometimes we were left trying to be the go between. Don't think a installer won't ruin some expensive trim only to claim it was never delivered leaving you to deal with the supplier who can show you on the invoice that it was delivered. See where i'm going with this. All this being said i am not saying not to use campbell's, just that quality and price being the same if you could purchase cabinets from a place that is responsible for installation you would have a lot less headaches. Also know this, if you are getting crown on your ceiling height cabinets and are also running your own crown in rest of the house, they will not match where they meet at and most of these types cabinets are generic in that they don't accomomodate just any sink and range top. you will have to do some retrofitting. something my installer thought wasn't his job, so i had to do it. and don't settle for a 10 inch overhang on your bar countertop, it's useless  .

Being that we were not told the policies we proceeded to try and order drinks and asked if one of the TVs could be changed to view another game.  That wasn't an issue.  The issue came when i asked for a drink after trying to sort through life in this establishment and the bartender said i had to run a tab.  I have already been sitting here why wasn't that the first thing you said?  So we had to go back to the table.  Fine!  We get to the table where we sit for another 15 waiting for service.  To say service was slow would be a disservice.  To say we were overlooked would be spot on. We constantly asked for items that were brought to us 30 minutes later or only after asking a 2 or 3rd time.  Not only did our waitress, Maria, not service our table we had to get help from other workers to locate her.  I hope she doesn't work on tips.

Superior Seafood is quite new and I hesitated to try anything; I like to wait and let the staff and kitchen work the kinks out. But, hunger won...  Sat at the bar and ordered:  Thyme After Thyme - vodka-based martini 1/2 Char-broiled oysters Tuna Tartar  My cocktail was too sweet. I think the idea is to have a more aromatic drink. I'd try it again, with instructions for less sugar. The oysters were decadent. Confession: 1st time having charbroiled ones. I love the raw bivalve, and this was a treat.   The tartar would use some tweaking. The presentation is fine; however, the tuna should be diced finer and the avocado is not really a great addition. I wasn't sure is the accompanying sauce was just soy, or ponzu. Was the sauce on the plate wasabi-based? All these things detracted from the tuna.   The hot bread with butter is delicious. But the bread served w/the appetizers is overkill. The bread w/the oysters is traditional, although you can't sop up sauce using toast points. I'd look for another option for the tartar.   The bartender was fine, perhaps a wee bit bored because it was a slow night. I'll try it again (after parade season) for a full meal and see...",Restaurants

Everything needed sauce, extra seasoning, or something to turn it up a notch.  I tried all 4 of their tacos (steak, tempura shrimp, mushroom, drum). Each dish ranged from $10-12 and came with two per order. My favorite was the tempura shrimp. It was fried well and had the most flavor. The steak was dry and not tender at all and they gave a lot of it. The mushroom taco was deconstructed and you have to put it together yourself. The drum was also dry and flavorless. A little hot sauce could have made each of these dishes a little better.   Octopus botanos - came with potatoes and poblano rice. Large pieces of octopus, rice was tasty.   Cauliflower app w/ salsa seca - roasted cauliflower, had good crunch to it. Salsa was creamy and just okay, not enough flavor. Not something I would order again.

Our first and second attempts were thwarted by day-of closures, which we were made aware of through social media. Finally, we were able to drop in on a Friday.   Getting to the place was relatively easy. The restaurant is located in the CBD between Canal and Tulane. Parking was not ideal. The parking lot was big enough but according to a sign on the door, it costs three dollars or you will get towed. However, there  was no apparent place to pay and no attendant in sight. We reluctantly parked on the street after a guy in front suggested it.  Once we were inside the music playing in the background (or more like in the foreground, given its volume) was as intimidating as the staff. Where most cafes opt for easy listening, Double Black filled the dining room with ""hood anthems"" (don't get me wrong, I love trap music but wasn't expecting it at a ""cafe""). The staff seemed to be disinterested at the notion of having new customers. They were not overly welcoming and explained their menu and ordering process in a hurry-up-you're-bother-me and  in a nearly inaudible way. Pricing is reasonable, as I ordered the Shrimp Wrap, which is under $10. I added the Style Fries and a drink bringing my bill a little under $15.   Where Double Black falls short in customer service and atmosphere they make up in the portion size and taste of their food. I dug into the fries first. They were delicious and some of the best I've had in a long time. They worked well with the sauce on top of them. It wasn't too heavily seasoned and they were just the right temperature. The same can be said for the wrap. The shrimp were a great size and cooked just right with a sweet/savory sauce in the wrap that brought it all together. The food may be worth some of the hype but the truth is, this restaurant is one of those places you might want to order your food and leave. When leaving this place you more than likely will not get a cheerful, ""Thank you. Come Back Soon."" but if the owners are basing their business on just taste alone, those niceties aren't needed...they know you'll be back.",Restaurants

1841,Mister Mao,29.9172216521,-90.102451183,3.0,"Mister Mao is a refreshing and funky new fusion concept restaurant that New Orleans never knew it was missing. While the restaurant is the tropical brain child of Chef Sophina Uong, don't get overly caught up at trying to label the menu as ""Asian fusion,"" ""tropical,"" or ""exotic."" While it may be a medley of all of those things, the menu does an excellent job at titillating your taste buds on a voyage of sweet, savory, spice and everything nice. Each cocktail was uniquely crafted to arouse and enhance their flavorful dishes. A push cart makes its way around the restaurant providing an inducement to add supplementary flavors to your table as the meal progresses. The inside has been beautifully remastered to the tune of a trendy jungle cocktail party. But remember, don't over think the labels or try to figure out what what genre/country the food is influenced from. Just have an open mind and embrace Mister Mao for being fun, quirky, unopologeticelly eccentric, and eager to parade a unique spectrum of flavors to your delight.

9,The Music Box Village,29.963591100000002,-90.0292571,17.0,"Ok. Simply put, the Music Box Village is one of the COOLEST things I have ever experienced in my life. Everyone knows that New Orleans is full of magic but I think this spot may just be the most magical and whimsical place in town. For a while, the Music Box Village used to do pop-up shows in City Park, but now their permanent location is hidden in a nook and cranny in the Bywater that is almost impossible to just accidentally stumble upon. Personally, I think that adds to the whimsy of it because it gives me a very Lion, Witch, and the Wardrobe kind of vibe. Make sure to pop the address into your GPS (it's at the end of the tracks behind Bar Redux). Some other logistical notes: limited parking so only park in the lot if you have children or need assistance (there is street parking available because it's nestled in a neighborhood), tix vary from 10-35 dollars per show (worth it), they do sell beer, there's usually a food pop-up (Congreso Cubano), kids are allowed, and no dogs (unless it's a service dog).  The New Orleans Airlift team has truly created a one of a kind experience. The venue is pretty large and is full of tiny house structures that are actually the instruments used in performances Truly, it's so hard to describe because of how mind-blowing it is, that you truly just need to visit it for yourself. Because of the setup, it's a completely immersive experience and there is no bad seat in the house (speaking of seats, you need to bring your own seats and folding chairs). It's the most original, innovative, and creative thing I've seen in a very long time. They have spring and fall shows that they usually put on and artists like Big Freedia, Solange Knowles, Wilco, and Tank and the Bangas have performed there over the last year.   Last night, I saw Tank and the Bangas perform an original piece that they developed themselves through their experimental music/spoken word/dance/art residency at the Music Box Village. In the middle of the performance, NORAH JONES rolls out on a mobile grand piano and performed a song. It was phenomenal. I've seen Tank and the Bangas perform many times but this was something totally different and unique in the best way possible.   If you are reading this, you have to check this place out for yourself. They open the village to the public during the daytime (hours and days are on their website) and I would highly suggest going, especially if you have kids. Admission is 12 bucks ($5 if you're local or a child). I highly suggest making it to a nighttime show though to fully get the magic of this spot. Even if you've seen a band a dozen times, the way the Music Box Village operates is so that the performance you are seeing there, will never/can never be replicated or done that same way again, so you are truly experiencing a once-in-a-lifetime thing. Magic. Pure magic.",Nightlife

Because we had been in NOLA for a couple of days when we wandered in, we noticed that the prices for things here were  higher than other places.  Not sure why!  But, this is definitely the kind of place that offers one stop shopping.  You can find virtually anything that is characteristic of New Orleans flavor.

Thank you for both quick fast casual service and easy takeout! Finally, thank you most of all for the superb customer service!  It's not just sandwiches, by the way. On a chilly fall day, pho was on my brain. The place was buzzing on a mid week afternoon. Clearly it's a favorite in the neighborhood and with good reason. Service is friendly and accommodating (more on this shortly) and the space is welcoming and quite open. Larger groups can be accommodated.  I ordered the vegan pho with tofu and an order of the fresh spring rolls. Both were good and what I needed (healthy, nourishing food) and what you probably need after a few days of excess (tourists, I'm looking at you). Honestly thought the pho could use some... heft, though. Noodles are plentiful, but veggies are not. Also, the tofu doesn't come tasty and fried as it does in places like Lily's, Mint and Magasin (though the really awesome counter guy who may be the owner said that I could definitely order it fried if I wanted, which is awesome). The fresh spring rolls come with a tasty peanut sauce... there was something missing in them, perhaps tofu? I've definitely had better and not sure if I'd order these again. Note to self: bring soy sauce in your bag next time, because there's none on the premises and this is a need for Yours, Truly whenever eating the tasty foods of Asia (and most other places. #addicted)  I really can't wait to return.

There is no better place to catch it then the Filmore. I've been to many music venue and always feel that most are jam pack with bodies and it gets a little way too suffocated with people smoking and body heats. The Filmore had the AC full blast but not to the point of being cold. The lighting and sound was amazing. The beautiful chandelier was a good touch to the decor. When you take the escalator up to the venue inside the Masquerade, you will have to stand in line before you can pass security to enter the music venue. I love it that we didn't have to stand outdoor like most music venue to get inside. There is a few bars inside once you enter. You can purchase your drinks and also bites to much on while waiting for the concert to start. I had a fantastic concert experience to catch my all time favorite band. Regarding to one less star in my rating was because once the concert is over, you have two exit to take, Canal or casino. We took the casino exit and there was a long wait of people wanting to head to the casino but there were only one usher checking our driver license to re-enter the casino. My problem with this is that when we were heading to stand in line, they check our driver license and gave us a wristband to indicate we were old enough to drink and not to mention we had to show our ID previously to even enter Harrah's casino. It was just ridiculous and unnecessary. There were so many unhappy concert goer who were ID even when they look way too old to be carded.",Nightlife

I live just outside the city now, but was in for a convention and my co-workers and I stopped in to La Cote as a last resort for lunch.  It's at a hotel, it looks generic-trendy, two things that usually mean bad, over-priced food.  Thats not the case at all.  The menu is full of real Louisiana food, each dish sounding more delicious than the next.  My co-worker got a shrimp po-boy that was so over stuffed with fried shrimp that she ate it with a fork.  The shrimp tasted sweet, like they were fresh from the gulf.  Another co-worker got the glazed salmon, which looked ridiculous and she gasped it was so good.  As for me, I got the roasted beet and goat cheese salad (yes not LA cuisine) and as the waitress said that the seafood stew was her favorite, that as well.  The stew came in its own tiny cast iron pot, that looked too small for my appetite, but every bite was full of sweet crab, crawfish, shrimp and the fantastic broth.  It was seriously delicious.  The salad had thick beet slices, goat cheese and arugula placed in a tower so when I cut into it i got a bit of all three.  The beet was soft, sweet, and in perfect ratio to the cheese and arugula.  The one fault I can find is that were some yellowing arugula on the plate, but arugula's so delicate that's understandable.  It was a fantastic salad none the less.  One thing that was unique about this place was the servers (it was lunch) were all women of color.  In a city dominated by white men in that position, that's really incredible.

Near the end of my trip I was starting to want something other than shrimp and oyster po' boys, catfish, jambalaya, gumbo and red beans.  Starting to.  I still would eat any of those items till the cows came home as long as I am in New Orleans, but I actually began craving meat pies of all things.  This was Louisiana, wasn't it?  Where could I satisfy my craving for a spicy meat pie?  Natchitoches.  But I wasn't going to Natchitoches.  My friend Mandy P. who was born and raised in Natchitoches, LA made me my first ever meat pies.  Similar to empanada in my culture, but had the spice and flavor of Louisiana that I LOVE.  So, it was what I craved and what I wanted.  Believe it or not, it's an item that isn't very easy to find in New Orleans.  There were a remote couple of places in the Quarter that had them on the menu, but I tried them at one place last time I was there and was not impressed, and the other looked like a tourist trap, so I steered clear.  Mandy P. texted me that I must go to Jacques Imos for them as soon as humanly possible, but it was well outside of the Quarter (St. Charles Street Car still isn't back on its full route) and perhaps maybe a little pricey for what I wanted.  I just wanted a simple fix and not a full sit-down meal.  So, John L. and I began our quest, peeking at menus posted outside of restaurants.  (I know, how touristy!)  He vowed, ""Don't worry.  I will find you some meat pies!""  After a handful of places I was starting to think this was a pointless search.  Until John mentioned a little grocery-type deli he passed on a previous stroll that we might try.  Not quite thinking they'd have meat pies (since my other grocery deli love, Verti Marte, doesn't carry stuff like that), we get there and a huge sign outside listed a number of items including ""crawfish pie.""  Wha??  Could they possibly have what I was looking for?  Listed at the top of their menu, forth item down:  MEAT PIE (seasoned cajun beef stuffed pastry deep fried to perfection) $2.50  CHA-CHING!  John came through.  And they were exactly what I wanted (none are like Mandy's, but still soooooo good).  We went back two more times for them towards the end of the trip. By the third time, the workers recognized us and the girl behind the counter merely asked, ""Meat pies?""  I know, sick.  But you can quickly become addicted to these tasty to-go morsels.  French Quarter Deli & Grocery just opened a little over a month ago, but I have a feeling they will do really well with their location, hours and menu.  Their menu is extensive, including appetizers (Mac & Cheese Bites, Crawfish Pistolettes, meat and crawfish pies, etc.), burgers, breakfast sandwiches, chicken wings, po' boys and other deli sandwiches, pastas (Peanut Chicken Pasta, XX Chili Pasta, Linguine with Garlic Butter Sauce and all sorts of add-ons, etc.) fresh salads, and much, much more.  They carry all kinds of beverages, liquors, wines and beers which, yes, they will gladly deliver along with your food order.  They are open and will deliver from the morning until the wee hours (3am on weekdays and 4am on weekends).  I'm so glad this place opened.

I can't stand sitting in an empty restaurant. The service was good to above average.   The $19.20 menu provides a few choices for each course. We both ordered the crab and shrimp cake for an appetizer. It was outstanding, one of the better appetizers I have had in a long time. I ordered the short ribs which were good but not great. The sauce was nice and the presentation was nice with a big Portobello on top which was tasty. But the short ribs were cut in pieces and were found under a mound of mashed potatoes. Nothing at all bad about the dish, it just didn't wow. My lovely better half ordered the fish ( drum I think) with tropical fruit salsa and coconut rice, a much better choice. It was very well prepared, especially the execution of the fish which was perfectly moist, cooked just right. For dessert, I ordered chocolate ice cream which consisted of a very tiny, kid's portion (not much more than a tablespoon )of very good ice cream accompanied by about a teaspoon of whipped cream. The better half again ordered better and got the peanut butter mousse which was a much larger portion and excellent, outstanding in fact.  So if you're looking for a nice evening at a grand restaurant but don't want to break the bank, come to Broussard's for good meal and overall dining experience during the $19.20 special. And, frankly, you should consider coming after the special is over. The food is that good.",Restaurants

It is an extra mile to venture outside of this area to a bank to get some cash and come all of the way back. It's an established place where New Orleanians come for wings, Cajun fries, and the famous ghetto punch! It's the most delicious punch I've ever had: not too sweet, not bitter, and a natural blend of flavors for the perfect punch.  After getting your cash, you would need to park under the bridge and walk across the street. Be careful and pay attention to the light. Keep your car locked and keep an eye out. At this locations there is no place to sit and eat, and it's not really comfortable to order and wait. You're standing the entire time, outside a pickup window; you can imagine how packed it may get if it rains or gets really cold outside.   Personally, l think the wings are rather dry: they could use some juice or some oil to keep them juicy. The fries I love, but not more than I love the punch! Get a large if you can; you won't regret it. It's a little bit of a hassle, this place; Yet and still, the food is enough for customers to keep coming back.",Restaurants

I would think as a bartender you would be more attentive to the people coming to your bar ! To make matters worse , there was a guy behind me trying to get service as well and he didn't get any . He made a comment to me saying "" If this isn't the worst service , idk what is ""! She would rather help what looked like her ""regulars""  rather than us new people to their establishment .

The food is expertly prepared and extremely creative.  They seem to specialize in pastries with interesting combinations of ingredients, for example today I had a savory tart with wild mushrooms and cheese, and there were tomato tarts and also one with beets that looked yummy. The mushroom tart I ate today was rich, buttery, and delicious. Of course, it's a bakery so they also have sweet baked things that looked very good.  They have sandwiches and salads that are just as creative as the baked goods:  this week they have a salad special with octopus and kale that looks so good from the photo they posted on Twitter and Facebook, it's haunting me and I might have to go back and try it for lunch tomorrow.  They also make their own bagels, which is super exciting for this born-and-raised-New Yorker.

The cheese option is weird too. They offer a sandwich slice of white cheese. I refused it, so I don't know if it's mozzarella or what.      Where they earn their stars is the other fillings.

In fact, two in our party were trying to go downstairs to smoke, as they could not smoke on the balcony, and were told that if they left they wouldn't be able to come back, even though they had an open bar tab. It was thoroughly disappointing for such a nice location to be that woefully unprepared. At one point there were two managers keeping people out, but no one helping the lone server.",Nightlife

That's right everyone this place served terrible food. In fact the food was so terrible that by the looks of things the owner was busy writing fake reviews in order to offset his bad ratings. But alas it did no good, cooking up fake reviews could not hide how bad this place was.  Now they are putting up a sushi restaurant in its stead. Hopefully they don't make the same mistakes as their predecessors.  In short a crooked business owner that posted fake reviews on yelp and still went out of business.

Purchased on Saturday, resized ring promised for Monday.  After FIVE visits and a laundry list of excuses (broken hip, out of silver, marcasites popped out when stretching [if stretched to size, why did they need silver?]), I made my FIFTH visit to inquire about the ring, which was supposed to be ready at 5 the evening before, then at 11 am was supposed to be ready in an hour, but wasn't.  I was no longer confident of the ring's quality after such a runaround (and popped out marcasites), so I asked for a refund: ""We don't do no refunds.""  I finally was able to pick up the ring the next hour. I wish I'd taken a picture of the ring before it went off for sizing, some of the marcasites are black, and there are more black ones on one side than the other.  Apologies? No, not really.

We went in to happy hour which was a great deal. 3 of their house cocktails are $4 and several of their ""snack"" items are $4 from 4-7 pm daily. We ordered the blue cheese and chili fries, their oyster & bacon dip, and their mini corn dog style shrimp.   It was all just a touch off. Remnants of Besh still remain but in an obvious cost saving manner: example the shrimp comes with an apricot mustard served in a tiny cast iron crock from the Besh days, but the crock is too wide and not deep enough to effectively dunk the shrimp like you would a corn dog. The oysters in the dip were minced and the bacon was undetectable - it was a tasty dip but not what we were expecting. The fries were pixie cut from the freezer. They could have been fried a bit longer as they came out anemic and the menu was deceptive!! At first I thought they'd be chili cheese fries. When I re read the menu I realized they would have roasted chilis and blue cheese. The dish that came out was fries covered in crumbled bleu cheese and scallions with an oil sauce that had a hint of peppers on the side. We were unsure if we were supposed to dip the fries or pour it over them, but decided to use the fries to eat the rest of the not quite oyster dip.  We did not order any entrees as the prices have jumped to $18-30 per plate and the snacks were not so great that they invited us to spend that kind of money there.

I don't usually take photographs in galleries, but I stopped to snap a photo of a painting that had some sentimental meaning to me (not having seen any no photography signs). The aforementioned docent rushes over and tells me not to take photos please (I  completely fine with this, their gallery, their rules.) But then she went on about how there are signs *everywhere* throughout the gallery and cameras everywhere (as if she thought I might abscond with a Takashi?!). I only saw one on photography sign when I got further into the gallery space. in any event, my partner and I roamed about the gallery a bit more, and I stopped to examine another piece by an artist that is very dear to me. The docent came up to ask if I ""knew anything"" about the work, and I replied pretty pleasantly that I loved the artist and had read about his work. She at that point said something like ""well then I guess you know everything you need to know about it""...I was not saying I was an expert, just that I was familiar with it. The thing that really rankled me about this interaction however was when I conversed with her a bit with my partner, she asked where we were coming from, and I said we were in town for a medical conference and that my partner (who was dressed in a logo T shirt) was attending as a surgeon in training. She perked up at that point and even gave me her card. I guess my point is 1) use the golden rule and 2) art is for everyone, not just people who look rich and important.",Shopping

Weird how in other cities going to a restaurant with different customs and language is part of the ""expereince"" but in mid-city new Orleans people act it's an annoyance.  ""oh NO...Mexicans and ""other Latinos"" drinking at the bar""....as someone said below....seriously?   Yeah so they have different customs and of course the bartenders and waitresses are  Honduran and ""other Latino"", as someone put it.  In fact one of the girls that worked there when I went was from Dominican Rep. so she was on Island time.....it's a Latino bar/restaurant and all part of the experience.  Get the ""mixed Fajitas"" and guarantee you'll forget about the language barrier and the fact there are real live-Latino's drinking at the bar...still laughing at that one!  Best fajitas you'll get anywhere and priced cheap for the heaping fresh cooked mound of shrimp, chicken and steak....yep you heard right..... and it WORKS.    Don't mind the  Hondurans  who are are mildly interested to see some gringos come in. They might even buy you a cold one if you smile!   Seriously....  Lighten up Orleans....this is a multi-cultural city. And this place adds to the mix.",Restaurants

I placed my order pretty quickly. From the time I walked in the door to the time my entr√©e hit the table was just over 45 minutes. A little longer than it should have been for lunch service. I ordered the Lemon Chicken Angel Hair. No lemon whatsoever. Pasta was plain with no sauce. The entire dish needed seasoning and the chicken was dry and overcooked. I will say that the server was very sweet and polite. I won't come back for anything other than the oyster bar.,Restaurants

There's some hope for the dish. Maybe they could make it with fresh fries. MAYBE they could go buy (or make) some garlic oil to douse the old fries in and revive them a bit. Maybe we could do fresh fries, rec #2, and micro plane the parm on with some salt and pepper, throw some herbs on there because I know y'all grow them.  My piece has been stated.",Nightlife

Not sure if they were not expecting the crowd they got that day because service was slooooowwww. Luckily tho, the hot tub along with those nice ladies i was talking to kept me preoccupied so i didn't deal with the bar too much. There were some great specials going on tho, $5 margaritas, $3 tequila shots, but of course one would expect such deals on a day like that.   Most of the crowd tho were being divas and not swimming, which kind of set a weird tone, but it's definitely a spot i'll be stopping into more over the Summer.

Only four taps (Guinness, Harp, Crispin Cider and Hoegaarden when we were there), but lots of bottles.  In fact, both of the second night there was a lively discussion on what other beers they should bring in.  The bathrooms are tiny, but have lots of fun items on the walls.

We arrived about 30 minutes before our scheduled reservation, and we sat at the bar and had a few cocktails while listening to the live piano music.  I ordered the No. 21 cocktail, and it was perfect.    After cocktails, we were led upstairs to the second floor of the restaurant where Mario waited on us.  He is amazing and knows the menu very well.  We both got the soup of the day to start, which was a baked potato and corn chowder.  The smoky flavor from the bacon in the soup was phenomenal.    The bread was also great!  There was an option of Ciabatta or a Jalape√±o corn muffin, and I opted to try both.  The Ciabatta bread was perfect for dipping into the soup, and the jalapeno corn muffin had the perfect flavor of jalapeno without being over-the-top spicy.   For my entree, I ordered the pumpkin gnocchi with duck prosciutto off of the appetizer menu.  The gnocchi was made fresh and to perfection, and the duck prosciutto was delicious and unique.  I also ordered a side of the caramelized brussels sprouts, which were also delicious.  I am greatly disappointed when I order brussels sprouts, and they are not cooked enough; however, Emeril's cooked them to perfection.  My boyfriend ordered the jerk spiced lamb loin, and he really enjoyed it.    To finish off the evening, we shared the Bananas Foster for two prepared tableside.  There really is no dessert like fresh Bananas Foster.    We had a wonderful evening, and we enjoyed the atmosphere of the restaurant, which was formerly a house.

The sandwiches are overstuffed, and she crisps the bread in a sandwich press for truly delicious combinations.  She uses imaginative juxtapositions of foods to bring out flavors I hadn't thought possible.  Most of her sandwiches have some form of ham and cheese in them, but my wife asks Donna to leave the ham off hers, and Donna always comes through with something good.  I like the food here enough that I eat her stuff probably twice to three times per week.  Everything I've ordered had melted cheese and tasty sauces that made me happy, and usually elicited comments from the people around me in the office or in the cafeteria.  ""Hey WHAT is that smell?""  ""Where can I get a sandwich like that?""  ""I've been watching you eating that thing, and I just have to know where you got it!""  Every time I bring one back to work i get comments like these.  The only issue I've heard people state about A Fork In The Road is that in order to produce these delicious sandwiches Donna has to take five to ten minutes per sandwich, and since her press can accommodate only two sandwiches, she can't - and won't - rush her creations.  Do not come to Donna with a ten-sandwich order at the height of the lunch rush, but if you're willing to wait a few minutes for a really delicious sandwich, come see Donna.

His mother made the reservation and also let the restaurant know that there would be one vegan in attendance.  I must that say that I was pleasantly surprised at both the outstanding menu accommodations and the excellent food itself!  The staff were very careful and deliberate in making sure my food was, in fact, vegan, and they served me with huge smiles, despite my being ""the difficult one"" at the event.  As an alternative to the gumbo opener, I was served a tomato-based soup that was warm and delicious, with just a bit of Cajun kick!  My salad was just an altered version of what the other got.  When I pointed to the dressing and asked what it was, I was politely informed of its ingredients.  I was served a vegetable curry in lieu of the shrimp dish and beef tenderloin dish the other guests got.  This curry was delicious!  I'm not going to lie, I was a little skeptic of a Creole/Cajun place making Indian food, but damn it; they nailed it!  My desert was raspberries, strawberries and blackberries served in a martini glass.  These berries tasted like they were literally picked off out of the garden ten minutes prior, rinsed and then given to me.  The only real ""complaint"" that I have doesn't even have anything to do with me, but my tablemate had to ask several times for a refill of his water, and it took almost twenty minutes for that to happen.  However, I credit the large group and server distractions for the delay.  Based on their excellence in general, I wouldn't hold this as an indicator of their service.

Most notably, I was there with a coworker to pick up a large online order totaling about $800 worth the lumber and miscellaneous materials.  The order was supposed to be cut to size and put aside for us when we called ahead to arrange a pickup.  That had not happened, and we waited FOR TWO HOURS before asking if we could do it ourselves (nevermind that I had come from work and was doing this in a pair or slacks, a shirt and tie).  Several employees came by in the meantime to vent about ""the day people"" whose responsibility it apparently was to pull our order, but did not lift a finger to assist us.  When we brought the lumber that needed to be cut to the back, the operator was very upset about having to cut all that wood ""that wasn't his job"".  Hey man, I get your upset, but I am the customer, it is not my fault your staff is dysfunctional.  After my coworker and I had loaded 96 8 ft 2x4's and 16 large sheets of plywood ourselves, the MANAGER came to introduce himself and apologize for the order not being prepared, assuring us that ""there would be consequences"" for the people responsible, while offering nothing to make things right for us, or compensate us for our labor and time that was wasted.  Does that man really think I am going to sleep better at night knowing that someone may lose their job this day in age?  What an inappropriate response to a glaring failure of customer service...seeing his lack of professionalism made the staff's lack of direction easier to understand.  The propane...don't get me started on the propane exchange there...firstly, I went in to exchange an empty cylinder, and an employee literally screamed at me to get the tank out of the store as if I had walked in with a dinosaur on a leash...Really, forgive me for not wanting to lose my deposit for leaving it outside...this is Central City after all.  After that, I was informed that they had no more propane (which was untrue), they just did not want to send someone out to the cages to look.  Turns out, 3/4 cages are on a key lock (which only one person has) and the last is on a combination lock (which multiple people have).  SO, when the cage with the combo lock gets empty, they would rather inconvenience a customer and lose business than take a minute to track down a set of keys.  Joke.  Silver lining, after this experience and others, I found a place to fill them rather than exchange them, which is a better value.  So, they have seen the last of me in the propane department, I will happily take my business elsewhere.",Shopping

He created a special dish for my mom that was low-carb. And he was playing in the kitchen creating new things, and he brought us out samples.   We ordered the fried oyster appetizer, the eggplant truffle fries, cornbread, Shrimp and Grits x2, The crab tower (crab cake topped with soft shell crab topped with lump crab meat), and a scallops and vegetables low-carb plate for my mom.

The prices were decent if my memory serves me correctly...which it's been failing as I age so...  I've only been here a handful of times, 3 times to see a band and once just to hang out.  My only gripe is no food or snacks on the regular.  My buddy and I went there once (my 2nd time) after I completed a photoshoot (i' m  a photographer) because we had the day to kill.  After a couple of cosmopolitans (just kidding) we were hungry! I was like, ""DAMN WE SHOULD EAT!""  the Bartender was like, ""sorry assholes, no food is served here, but I can have food delivered from one of these places""  of which he displays a handful of menus.    Being we were that close to Magazine, we decided to skip on over and grab some sushi from some place that kinda sucks..so i don't even remember the name.  But once our bellies were filled, we mosey'd on back to Carrollton Station.  The 2 stools at the bar were nearly still warm from our asses before the late lunch (or early dinner).  2 more drinks in, we were feeling really good and figured why not extend this great evening to some friends and partake in our unplanned festivities!  we were like ""HEY, WE ARE POPULAR! AND KNOW SOME HOT CHICKS...LET'S INVITE THEM!""  So both of us scrolled through our phones as the bartender kept the steady flow of liquid refreshments coming in.   After 15mins of texting and calling we had completed our invites.  On short notice, we managed  i think 2 chics and 1 dude.  Well, at least it wasn't 2 dudes and 1 chic.  None of us were available so it's not like were trying to hook up.  1 of the girls I had been wanting to shoot for some time now and we were able to schedule it!  Wait, this is supposed to be a review of the bar right?  Ok,  so it's also a music venue. It's a little small, but actually not bad at all.  If you get there early enough before the crowds, you can grab a table right in front the stage, but if you don't...no biggie, you can hear the music from anywhere in the bar and probably get a decent view of the band providing there are no 6'5"" assholes standing in the front.  This bar is also right across from another one called The Boot.  I've never been but I hear people talk about it occassionally.

Mind you I worked at a tanning salon for 4 years and NEVER paid for tanning, so this was a lot of money for me to spend!!!

After using 4 spray tans over the course of the next couple of months, I entered the salon for my next spray and was informed that I NO LONGER HAD ANYMORE TANS!!!!  Apparently, when I bought my package of 8 spray tans, they actually only gave me 4!????!!!  The man working was not apologetic, nor did he attempt to accurately research or respond to my concern, that I had paid for 8 and that there should be 4 more left.    I was very calm and asked for the owner to call me, which she never did. It has now been two weeks and the situation has yet to be resolved. I returned to the salon today, only for the same guy to tell me, ""its not my fault the owner hasn't called you"" and act very rude to me!!!   I was shaking when I left there!!!!!   THIS IS FRAUD!!!!

Items include:  *  odd bars of soap to ward off all sorts of evil *  exquisite and unique pieces of jewelry *  lots of art *  lots clothing items to peruse.  When I was there with a group of my friends, they featured some beautiful jewelry pieces, and my friend Elise picked such a novelty necklace that she adores.  MR.

Cheeky monkeys aside, I spent $33 plus tip for 2 burgers, an order of chili cheese fries and 2 cokes. I'll let you decide.

2798,The Bower,29.9377653,-90.0712579,21.0,"Went here the other night, a new and very stylish restaurant on what had once been an utterly nondescript stretch of Magazine St. Did the Coolinary menu (plus an extra app). The verdict? Excellent food, excellent service, excellent value. The only thing not excellent? My photos which don't do the dishes full justice. Can I give it 4 1/2 stars?!  I got there around 8pm. It was almost full. I was seated at a four-top, which was fine, tho I did offer to sit at the counter by the kitchen as I didn't want to take up extra space. My server Randy was very knowledgeable and guided me to choices that left me happily sated.  Started with the Verlasso Salmon (fermented Napa cabbage, cashews, cilantro, sweet peppers, sesame seeds, black garlic vinaigrette) SO delicious!! (Note: The presentation was MUCH nicer than my photo; I had already had a bite or two before taking the pic. It arrived in a kinda pyramid formation.) It's the type of dish you want to have another of as soon as you finish eating it. Sometimes in a dish like this you get lotsa the extras and only a little of the featured item. Not here; there was LOTS of salmon!  Decided to splurge and also get the Roasted Bone Marrow with pistachio pesto, oven roasted cherry tomatoes and watermelon radish slices, as you don't often see this on menus. Not only was it very very good but (a) unlike some places where you just get the marrow and some bread or, in this case, baguette slices, here the pistachio pesto, oven roasted cherry tomatoes, watermelon radish slices and, a goodly amount of, I believe, dill, fleshed it out wonderfully & imaginatively and (b) for a change, there was a pleasingly plentiful amount of baguette slices so I didn't have to ask for more. Bone marrow may not be to everyone's taste...which just means more for me!!  Crispy Pork Chop (grilled corn, mint, cucumber, avocado, buttermilk, watermelon molasses) Crispy it was; I actually thought it was too crispy, but hadn't realized that was what it was billed as--though I wouldn't've minded it being a little more tender/moister, I guess you can't complain about something for being what it's supposed to be. That said, the watermelon molasses (the brown swirl around the pork chop) was so yummy it should be sold in sex shops for people to spread all over their partner's body after which it can be licked off. Lol Seriously, I asked my server for more of it and covered that part of the chop that wasn't already covered with the buttermilk. I don't think I licked its ramekin...but I sure wanted to!   Salted Caramel Budino (orange and pistachio)  I wasn't familiar with the budino concept and, while I enjoy caramel, the pleasures of the ""Salted"" part always escape me; once I got to the pudding beneath the caramel topping, however, I didn't want it to end!  I also had a very nice, and nicely priced, glass of the Syrah/Cinsault/Grenache rose. Light, refreshing, not too dry and with a nice bouquet, it was just what I was in the mood for.  About the only glitch was when I asked the ma√Ætre d' if he could turn up the light a little bit as it was awfully dark at my table; it didn't seem like it would be a big deal as the lights had momentarily bumped up just before. He came back a few minutes later saying that ""the manager was busy"" so apparently he couldn't do anything about it. I understand that staffing there is a little crazy due to COVID challenges but this hadn't seemed like a biggie. He did offer to move me to another table but by then I had settled in so declined. Not a biggie but it would've been nice to better see my food.  I understand that due to COVID craziness, most of The Bower's menu (the cheese and charcuterie boards) is currently from its adjacent bistro, Claret. When things return to normal, I was told that The Bower's options would expand offering more entrees along the lines of what I had. Can't wait!",Restaurants

The truffle fries were delicious, and my date's chicken sandwich was also very good.  The coleslaw was a bit mayonnaisey, but the green onion was a very nice touch and complemented the sandwich's flavor well.  My chipotle burger was decent, but I thought it was a notch below some of the other gourmet burgers around town (see, e.g., the Luke Burger).    The Martinis were good, but a little on the pungent side.  After I asked the bartender to make them with a little less vermouth.   What was Bad:  The Cajun Scallop Salad.  There were two important things which were wrong with this dish.   First were the scallops.  I know they were billed as ""blackened and seared,"" but they were more than undercooked.  They were mushy and lukewarm in the middle -- in short, totally raw.    Second was the level of spice for the salad.  I'm no prude when it comes to spice -- I probably put more tabasco on my red beans than most of you.  But this salad was so hot that any of the other flavors of the salad were completely overpowered.  The jicama?  It might as well have not been included.  The honey chipotle pecans?  They might as well have been cardboard.  In light of the $17 price for this dish, you expect more.",Restaurants

They had a tiny bit of kick to the balance out the sweetness and were cooked perfectly. The potato was huge and I definitely had half leftover. It could have used some extra toppings because it's a lot of potato to eat with it, but overall I was happy with my choice.   My SO got the Buffalo chicken potato and a side of macaroni and cheese. I had a bite of his potato and thought it had great flavor. I unfortunately didn't try his macaroni and cheese but he said it was delicious.

2277,Verizon,29.9774065935,-90.0979655,19.0,"I had an awful experience at this Verizon store just yesterday.  Around two weeks ago my cell phone broke and the Verizon back home (New York) quickly got me a new one through my insurance (Asurion).  The replacement phone was sent to me down in New Orleans, but unfortunately it was not working properly.  I took it to this Verizon store and they figured out it was the sim card reader, which could not be repaired.  I had to put in a second claim with Asurion to get a second replacement phone, which came in the mail two days ago.    After I received my second replacement I was unable to get service on my phone (i.e. making and receiving calls).  I brought the phone to Verizon.  They said the reason I could not make/receive calls was because my phone line was suspended due to a ""a report that the phone has been lost or stolen"".  Immediately the Verizon staff member (Sergei) said I ""must have"" suspended my service with Verizon.  I said that I had never done that, and he reacted as if I were lying.  Next he attempted to unsuspend the service and didn't make it 10 minutes before saying that Asurion was the one that claimed I had a lost/stolen phone and that Verizon couldn't do anything about it.  I called Asurion and they told me that they did not, and do not, put in lost/stolen claims, only broken phone claims.  Not only did they not do what Verizon was accusing them of doing, but they couldn't rectify VERIZON's issue even if they wanted to.  Literally during the phone conversation with Asurion, Sergei takes the phone from me and says (regarding me) ""this guy doesn't know what he's talking about"".  At that point I had enough--this man was accusing me of suspending my own service, then saying Asurion is the reason my line was suspended and they couldn't unsuspend it for me, then that I am clueless.    At this point I asked for the supervision.  He disappeared for 15 minutes and I left the store.  Later I spoke to Verizon on the phone and it turns out that Verizon's Device Management Department mislabeled the phone as lost/stolen.  After 1.5 hours on the phone with a polite, respectful and competent Verizon member, the situation was resolved and my phone worked again.  TLDR: While I can't speak to the stock or sales aspect of this store, the customer support, in my brief experience, is awful and frankly disrespectful.  You are better off calling Verizon than walking into this store for support.  If you happen to find yourself under the same circumstances I was in, avoid Sergei at all costs.",Shopping

Merchant is totally the venue of my dreams when it comes to a place I can go if I need to get out of the house and work. It has EVERYTHING.  All the other coffee shops and bars I frequent for quality time with my laptop have one or more failings - small tables, too few outlets, inconvenient hours, inconvenient location, no caffeine, no booze, crappy wifi. However, Merchant has everything I could want from a coffee shop. And then some. First of all, the space is gorgeous. I feel like I'm in another city, somewhere in Europe, because the design is very, well, designed. In a good way. You'll see what I mean when you step inside.   The coffee they serve, Illy, is a fantastic brand. High octane and delicious. And perfectly prepared by extremely friendly, helpful and customer-oriented staff. Everyone I've encountered at Merchant has been a delight, which is certainly not always the case at most places.  In addition to great coffee, they serve food (I've had breakfast, lunch AND dinner there by now, since they're open all day until 8pm), and although I haven't tried it yet, I know they serve booze (because what else could ""grapes"" stand for in the ""Coffee, Crepes, Grapes"" that serves as their tagline). Speaking of crepes, I'm so glad to have somewhere other than the places Uptown to get a nutella filled crepe when I have a craving. All places should sell nutella crepes, but that's another story.  So. Merchant has coffee, food, booze, and ambiance. The attention to detail is apparent in the way the tables are set up in the corridor area (just off the main bar where you place your order), because each table has power outlets next to it on the floor, and there are potted plants that serve as dividers between the tables, which afford some privacy if you're there for a meeting (or just don't like people staring at you when you're hunched over the computer, posting status updates to Facebook about how you should really be working). The wifi connection is good, in my experience. On top of all that, the tables themselves are large, so you've got plenty of room even if you've got coffee, plates of food, and two laptops spread out in front of you. Which I know because I've tried this.   Cannot tell you how happy I am to have found THE perfect coffee shop for the freelancer who sometimes wants to be around people (instead of cats) and wear real clothes (instead of pajamas). This is definitely a place I can spend hours and hours being productive, without having to leave for food/coffee/functioning internet, etc. Hooray for Merchant!

He also mentioned being open to any suggestions and they are always open to adding to their collection.

The locals in this neighborhood don't yelp, so don't be swayed by the reviews of unadventurous tourists. You won't find better soul food in the neighborhood.   We flew in from D.C. on a trip, and I wanted to eat local flavors at a local spot. My group was doubtful because it is inside a convenience store and there is no seating inside.

I joined their e-club online in which I supply them my email address and receive information about special promotions and deals and decided to visit this location for ""Free Croissant Day,"" or ""Bonjour to Fall.""   I do sometimes get actual meals or food items from La Madeleine, but this time I went to just get the croissant since I had a fruit salad with me and wanted to take advantage of the nice, fall weather and bring my food to Audubon Park. I asked the lady at the register for the promotional croissant, she turned and told what looked to be a manager and told her about my free croissant inquiry. This woman angrily mocked my by shouting ""Free croissant day,"" rolled her eyes and shoved a croissant into a bag and tossed it at the checkout girl. This croissant made it's way to me, and the manager-esque lady snarkily told me ""Bon appetite, have a nice day.""   I'm sure that the chain decided on this promotion to entice customers to come to the cafe in hopes of making other purchases. I do come to La Madeleine for their soup and sometimes their pastries, but this experience reminded me why I hate chains. Free croissant or not, this experience just left me with a bad taste in my mouth. I won't be coming back to this location and would like to recommend others do the same. My croissant was nothing special, and normally at $2.00 a pop, it's no steal to visit this chain.

It's amazing and a great compliment to fresh veggies and warm tortilla. The black beans are smoky and delicious and I recommend you sub shredded cabbage for lettuce for a nice change in flavor profiles. The chipotle sauce is a favorite as well. Just watch for the nickel-and-diming that can happen when you add things like sour cream and guac. It can add up quickly. Also, have the queso. It's warm and beer-y and delicious. If you're not in the mood for beer or a margarita, pair your meal with the Jamaica tea, sweetened hibiscus goodness.

Day 3 breakfast featured tasty bacon and eggs, which I only nibbled due to a previous 6 AM walk over to Cafe du Monde for coffee and beignets.

We were very impressed with the flavor and attention to detail- the plating was beautiful.

Today I decided to dine in and that ended up being a huge mistake. After placing my order I witnessed the atrocity of how the food is prepared. Out of the three people working the place, two were not wearing any form of gloves in preparing the food. The person working the register, who touches cash and cards, was bare handing the salad and chips into the serving trays. He also was seen wiping his nose multiple times prior to repeatedly cutting bread or again placing the salad / chips on the trays with his bare hands. This was not the only problem. He also had a rag he used to wipe down the area where food is prepared. This is the same rag he used to wipe his hands with (oh did I say he was wiping his nose and touching cash?) and while taking orders proceeded to place said rag in his arm pit. This rag used to wipe down where the food we eat is prepared.

But a small cooking accident and a burned hand lead me to order out at this South Chinese/Vietnamese place, and I was pretty satisfied with the result.  My order was hot and freshly ready in just under ten minutes; I barely had time to hit an ATM around the corner. It wasn't super cheap; I paid for two dishes what I would have paid for three at the cheapest of such places, but the portion sizes were such that I'll get 2.5-3 meals anyway, which is about right for the price. And it was respectable American Chinese cuisine, with my Kung Pao dish highlighted by a mix of vegetables and a decent amount of peanuts, and my lemongrass tofu having the option of noodles or rice with a little salad and separate sauce on the side. Nothing world-beating (and if I wanted to, I could get mad at them for their spicy dishes not being particularly hot), but I got a good meal.  For some reason it came in styrofoam containers rather than the typical Chinese food cartons, and I was instructed to hold the bag level to avoid spillage; even being cautious, there was still a bit of sauce on the bottom of the bag. If they wanted five stars from me, they could do things like improve those containers or not sneak broccoli into dishes where it isn't listed or offer non-soy vegetarian dishes for variety, but their menu now isn't bad.  Their online menu proudly proclaims that the dishes in its vegetarian section are ""prepared with vegetarian ingredients"", which sounds redundant until you realize that Chinese places can and will sneak in something that isn't. So I appreciate that notification, and will most likely order something else from that menu the next time I decide I want Chinese takeout.",Restaurants

2094,Orchid Seafood,29.975298300000002,-90.0792518,17.0,"New Orleans is one of the few cities where excellent cuisine comes from sketchy, health code questionable, corner stores. Orchid Seafood is no exception.   The entire place is about the size of a typical neighborhood store. There are no tables and chairs; it is a to-go style place. Also, don't kid yourself. The corner store designation is a bit generous, as their stock of dry goods is seriously lacking (mainly just cold drinks and candy...don't come here trying to make groceries). But you come to Orchid for the hot food.   The food is always hot and fresh, well seasoned, and the shrimp and fish are a generous size.  The service is quick and the women behind the counter are polite. The prices run anywhere from $6 - $15 depending on what you're ordering and some items are a little steep for a corner store but well worth it ($8 for the pasta...sheesh). If you're ordering something that hasn't been freshly made, they will politely ask you to wait....and I will always wait for hot shrimp, fresh out the grease.  My deduction of one star is mainly because the credit card minimum (aren't those illegal anyway?) and the food is inconsistent. The shrimp pasta is great, but if you get a scoop that's more cheese than shrimp, suddenly you're eating a salty sort of mac and cheese. Overall, excellent corner store fare, which natives know is the true fine dining of New Orleans.",Restaurants

Let me just say, right off the bat, the service was terrible.  There were two girls at the front counter - one was ambivalent, unfriendly, and seemed unhappy to be at work, and the other was downright rude.  The owners of this place should really take a close look at their staffing, because poor service like this can steer customers away permanently (see, e.g., Slim Goodies).  To be honest, these girls made me feel unwelcome.  However, once I received my order, all was well.  The coffee was fresh and delicious (and to update on the soymilk situation, per one review down the page, they do have it now!), and the bagel with cream cheese that I ordered was absolutely delicious and came out very quickly.  The bagels are a tad on the small side, but I'm not one for huge American-sized portions, so it didn't bother me a bit.    I do wish they fountain drinks, but as they are a new place, I will give them some leeway and hope that they add them soon.  Also, just a note, if you're ""plus sized,"" you will probably not want to dine-in.  All the chairs at Artz have sides on them that will prohibit the larger customers out there from sitting in them.",Restaurants

In regards to sandwiches, like I said, I had previously only had them catered and was not a fan.

I went to this McDonald's this morning and wanted to get the breakfast burrito combo but substitute hashbrowns for an oatmeal. The girl told me no. And I know you can substitute because you can substitute anything. Particularly if you willing to pay for it. But I wouldn't have to pay for it considering I have done it so many other times because I do not like McDonald's hashbrowns because they're not salted. Then I went to taste my tea after leaving the store already because when I asked the lady that was an unsweet tea she said yes, I go to taste it and it's a sweet tea.

French fries were fresh too (they seemed to be cut on site and not frozen).    Chef Dan is not only a great chef, but truly understands customer service. I was visiting the area with my family and stopped by for lunch.  Tulane's campus was essentially closed with students on break so the restaurant closed early and had a limited menu.  Regardless, Dan (who had already started cleaning the kitchen) was still willing to cook for us.   I would recommend Rimon to anyone visiting the area looking for a kosher meal.

After finding street parking near the mattress store, we plopped down and ordered the 3-taco plate (al pastor, mmmm) with beans and rice on the side and a burrito (barbocoa).

There were actually 2 pieces I liked but I passed on the first one because it was Free People which is the bulk of my wardrobe being I am from Philly, so I opted for the second which was a label I'd never worn.  It's really expensive here (imo) but worth it because the selection is obviously carefully picked and the experience is very easy and fun and comfortable.

The mac and cheese was good as was the potato salad, but again they lacked any exceptional flavor.  The greens lacked flavor too, even though she said they were cooked with pork.

This was a very clean bar and my husband and I enjoyed meeting some people in the courtyard and playing cornhole. I gave them 4 stars because they didn't have a waitstaff-you had to order your drinks from the bar, and I didn't get a welcoming friendly vibe like I did at other places.

The meatball is nothing special, but the one medium sized oxtail was delicious as well as the 6 or 8 slices of filet.  The brisket was tasty as well.

I tried the shrimp remoulade and fried green tomato po boy, which was good, but not great. I didn't remember to ask for it dressed and it wasn't offered, so maybe that would have helped.

The willow justs want to lock you in their shit hole so you will pay for their over priced shitty crown mixed drinks id be happy to pay $9 for a double at a nice venue like the joy but not at this dump. The willow is only able to bring in washed up irrelevant  names like aaron carter, afroman, riff raff, or any noob loyola music industry student willing to play for free. Although these Freshman music industry kids from loyola could run this joint better. This shit place needs to be closed down. They do not properly pay thier bartenders and accept way too many fake IDs. All i wanted was fair reentry. i paid for my ticket months before the show.

I brought it in and he fixed me up with a new rear tire and rebuilt my rack for a very decent price.

I was kind of embarrassed but he didn't seem to mind too much.   Yesterday I stopped by again right before a job interview because it was raining and I suddenly realized the necessity of fenders. I walked in sopping wet with a mud streak up my butt and he told me to come back in just half an hour and he'd have them installed. I grabbed a cuppa and when I returned my bike looked smashing!

3448,Pure Barre - New Orleans,29.9203875,-90.1053679,17.0,"I wanted to love Pure Barre. I really, really, really wanted to love Pure Barre. I moved to New Orleans from a city where Bar Method (a similar type of workout) was incredibly popular, and because I had gotten myself addicted to it (seriously!), I was really excited to find Pure Barre here.  In theory, Pure Barre is a phenomenal workout that will lengthen muscles and lift and tone everything. The substance of the class is a combination of ballet, pilates, yoga, and strength work. It definitely helps to have a dance background, or at least some level of body awareness, but it's not necessary. It is similar to Bar Method (opening soon in Covington but not in New Orleans yet) and Xtend Barre (two New Orleans locations).  My main problem with Pure Barre is that the instructors don't give form corrections - which may seem like a minor point, but when you're doing the small, isometric movements that are the key to the class, it's very important to have proper form. Otherwise, you don't get the full benefit of the exercise, and you could even hurt yourself. Unfortunately, Pure Barre places almost no emphasis on form. Yes, the teachers will occasionally remind the class to keep proper form, but they do not give any individual corrections. Because of this, in the classes I've taken, over 50% of the class will have incredibly poor form at any given time...and they probably don't even know it! I am a former dancer with a lot of experience in this type of class, but even I sometimes am not sure whether my form is right - in Bar Method, I relied on instructors to correct me, but in Pure Barre, I just feel like a fool going through the movements in what's possibly a completely improper way.   What I also dislike about Pure Barre - and really, this is more me missing Bar Method than disliking PB - is that the instructors aren't as enthusiastic or encouraging as I feel like they could be. Bar Method teachers encourage each student by name, giving positive feedback when it's deserved. Pure Barre teachers do this once in a blue moon. As a suggestion, to any of the teachers reading this, a little motivation really goes a long way!  My other main problem is the price - at $25 a class, and $225 for a month of unlimited classes, Pure Barre is one of the most expensive workouts I've ever heard of, especially in New Orleans. The new client special of $100 for an unlimited month of classes is a good deal, but after that, I don't think it's worth it.  The instructors at Pure Barre are all very nice, and Pure Barre COULD be a great workout, but it just isn't there yet. I'll wait for Bar Method to open in Covington instead.",Shopping

Ideally, a place that specializes in the Bills filled with long suffering Bills fans would be good.  Throw in some decent chicken wings and Canadian beer and we would have a winner. If this place did exist, it would be attracting a pretty exclusive crowd -all the beautiful people -  intelligent, classy, incredible sense of style, witty.... you get the idea.  So, when I got a tip that there was a bar in the CBD that was making it's name as a Bills bar, I was intrigued.   Not a dive bar, someone has clearly spent a fair amount of money restoring the building to capture the dive look.  Its pretty nice.  Further proof? The acid test is always the bathroom - the fixtures are still white, no mold or mildew - clearly, they've been cleaned in the last 6 months.  No self respecting dive bar would be sporting white fixtures.  The decor is interesting.  What is with all the John Daly stuff?  Multiple TVs are available, about half tuned to the Bills game.  The Saints weren't playing at that time.  Need to see how many TVs are tuned to the Bills when they are playing at the same time.  The most Bills fans I have ever seen in one place in New Orleans.     It was great to ask for a ""Blue"" and have the bartender know what you are talking about.  If you're not familiar with the order, give it a try.    Chicken wings - decent size, crispy - the medium was totally lacking in fire.  I'll try hot next time.    NO SMOKING!  If you're from any of the enlightened states, you likely already appreciate the benefits of a ""no smoking"" bar.  If you spent your life south of I-10, you will learn to love it.

2822,Sheraton New Orleans Hotel,29.952145812199998,-90.06810665129998,15.0,"I had high hopes for the Sheraton New Orleans.  I was staying here for a convention and got a room on the club floor.  Here's the good. If you're staying on a club floor, you'll have access to the club lounge, which serves free breakfast and appetizers with a fully stocked non-alcoholic fridge.  Also, because I was on a club floor I had an amazing view of the city.  The club floors are highest floors in the hotel.  (There are 49 floors; I stayed on the 47th floor.)  The hotel was also a great place for our conference.  We had plenty of space for all the events, and the conference rooms were nice.  Plus, the Sheraton has a great location on Canal Street, so it's a short walk to Bourbon Street and the French Quarter.  Here's the bad, and the reason for the 3 star rating.  The wifi in the hotel isn't that great.  I stayed 4 nights and had to reconnect every 24 hours.  The reconnection process was super slow and would sometimes kick me off the wifi for hours.  So, that was obviously a huge inconvenience.  When I checked out, I complained to the front desk staff about the wifi and was credited 500 Sheraton points.  It was a nice gesture, but I would have preferred working wifi instead.    Second, not so great thing - no mini bar in the room.  I realize all the prices of items in the mini bar are generally outrageously expensive, but it still would have been nice to have the option, especially when the hotel requests for its guests not to bring outside alcohol into the hotel.  It just doesn't make sense.  If you don't want us to get it elsewhere, then supply us with it to begin with.     Third, false charges made to my room.  When I went to check out I was told that I had been emailed a copy of my bill.  That's great.  I love having a copy I won't lose, but the server was down, and the bill wasn't sent.  So, I asked for a hard copy.  When I got it, I noticed a mysterious room service charge on my bill that I didn't make.  I was told to call Sheraton customer service to dispute the charge.  I have dealt with Sheraton customer service before and they have always routed me back to the individual hotel because the call center doesn't have authority to make certain decisions.  I knew if I was going to get the charge removed it would be when I was checking out with a live person standing in front of me.  At my insistence that she show me the room service bill, the front desk lady finally left to hunt it down.  After 20 minutes she returned and apologized because no bill could be produced.  It really makes me wonder if something sketchy was happening.  If someone had accidently charged something to my room because their room number was similar, wouldn't a bill be available for me to see?  Regardless the charge was removed, so I was happy about that.    I appreciated the gestures to make amends for the mistakes (mysterious room service charges & spotty wifi), but I it's still annoying to have to take extra time to prove I'm not a liar.  I might come back here again, but with so many other choices of hotels in the area, I probably won't.",Restaurants

However, to celebrate my husband's birthday, we needed to get what he wanted and what the man always wants is STEAK! No frills, just a good man steak. With that said, I did enjoy my meal, especially the onion rings. They are crisp and super thin just the way I like them. I really enjoyed the filet I had as well, and my husband had no complaints and no leftovers of his cow sized steak. And though I tried to get him to go to where there is a tad more flare, we are going back again for his birthday this year. But I am looking forward to a predictably good meal and service (and a great coolinary deal!) After all, if you want some good meat and potatoes, Charlie's is the place to go!

This was one of the best decisions I made on my trip.   Jeff the guide was great. He was funny, knowledgeable and a wealth of information. Because of him I got to join in the fun in what us outsiders call a parade but locals call a second line. If you have a chance to be a part of an authentic second line do not hesitate. Thx Jeff for the heads up. I will always remember that experience. He also gave me a heads up on the best dessert place in the city, Angelo Brocato's. This advice alone was worth the cost of the tour. I also got the inside scoop on a few other places the locals enjoy. So thanks to Jeff the remainder of my trip was fantastic. I really got to explore like a local.  Well back to the tour. I took the Creole Tour on a beautiful Saturday morning. The group was just the right size. The pace was very slow, which was good because you still got to see stuff even when you were riding your bike. Do not be intimidated if you are a couch potato on the regular, this was such an easy ride even YOU can do it. The 3 hours just flew by.  But don't worry toward the end of the trip we stop at a local dive bar to get some libations. I decided my biking skills might suffer even with one drink so I passed.

We ordered and the food took a fair amount of time, understandable because of such a large party. Problem was, when the food came out, no server knew what we'd individually ordered, so it became a huge mix up with people eating others' food.  I ordered the pork belly tacos which had a great caramelization on the outside and tender inside. I also ordered the spicy beef pho, which was perfectly balanced with flavor after adding the accompanying bean sprouts and limes.

It's only a few blocks off of canal st. for a point of reference. The park is essentially a beer garden oasis and an outdoor venue for local musicians. There is live jazz everyday from 10am until they close, which I believe is midnight and it's free! Within the park there is a bar, so the crew and I grabbed some drinks and sat and vibed to jazz for a couple of hours and people watched. It is definitely a great experience sitting and soaking up some of the rich culture and musical heritage that New Orleans has to offer.

I wanted to reserve a table for a party of 10 and decided to call them a week prior (Saturday). I was told to call back the upcoming Wednesday for a reservation. Let's back it up a bit: I called them about a month prior to the actual event just to get some details about reservations. I was given a presumably complete rundown. Fast-forward: I called Wednesday and was told I'd have a manager call back. No return call. I called around 12 times between Wednesday and Thursday with no answer. I was persistent because this was the only local hookah bar that seemed to our liking. By Friday, I finally got a response in which I was informed that in order to reserve, I would have to physically come in and purchase a bottle. That was a definite inconvenience because the person who would actually have to pay was now out of town. So, I gave it a chance and told my party to just see if they could go in when Saturday arrived. I stayed back due to illness. The place was really packed according to the birthday boy. He assumed he had reservations there, which he somehow didn't comprehend when I explained everything to him. However, when he mentioned my name to the owner or manager, he remembered our conversation and my persistence and decided to seat them within a short time frame.

If you want a cheap hot dog, go get a Lucky Dog people!!  I got the red bean chili dog with fried chicken, because who doesn't want a hot dog topped with friend chicken?!  The red bean chili is such a good idea!  I thought it would be just like red beans and rice, but it was made like an actual chili and I loved it.

When we dined here, the entire place was empty except for us...and the family that owned it.

And don't forget those dollar bills for tipping-- the street artists and musicians are fabulous!!!!  The talent abounds within the streets of this cobble stone city. It's an epicurean paradise--- full of seafood and creole, and cajun cooking. I mean, before we met, I had no idea that you could make so many dishes with crawfish!!!!!!  Pack your Rolaids, my friends. Oh, NoLa.... there's a festival happening almost every week in this town. The party never stops with you, and like the tshirt says---Soul truly is Waterproof.

Many people seem to love it also they bring their kids and dogs. I love the food but some options can be pricey selections range from $3-8. You can sample food from Lucy's to Theo's pizza here. I love trying food from vendors who don't have their restaurants yet like Miss Linda Yakamein Lady and Cook Me Somethin Mister Jambalaya.  I love that some of the sponsors are The New Orleans Saints and Pelicans so you get an opportunity to see Gumbo or the Dance Squads and take photos of or with them. If you are lucky you may even catch a shirt that they shoot with a blaster in the Crowd.  The only drawback to the Park I think is not enough seating area closer to the stage.

The previous day I had dropped in and questioned a server about their vegan pizza options, which the restaurant was promoting on its sidewalk sandwich board. The server was friendly and enthusiastic. She indicated that one of our options would be to build our own pizza.  When we arrived and were seated, we were met by a surly server who gave every indication of not wanting to be there. We should have left, but we persisted. He told us the build your own option was not available and he was impatient when we asked for modifications to the single vegan pizza (""Hail Seitan"") offering on the menu. His service became increasingly hostile.  The pizza that we were served was dull and bland. It had very few toppings except potato chips, which did not work well on the pizza. There was so little vegan cheese on the pizza, it was hard to detect the flavour. Never have we seen a restaurant so badly mess up their primary menu item as this restaurant did.  New Orleans does not appear to have a lot of vegan restaurants, but many mainstream restaurants seem to try to accommodate vegans. This attempt at accommodating vegans was desultory and ill-mannered. Vegans should avoid this restaurant and spend their money at a more appreciative place.",Restaurants

True musicians and great personalities to boot. I can only imagine that this is what concerts were like 50 years ago. The band members were dapper, engaging and insanely talented.

Well, that problem has now been solved as El Libre is now conveniently located on Calhoun.  I stopped in on a Monday for lunch and the place was empty. It's an ""order at the counter"" type of place and they serve a few signature Cuban dishes as well as their legendary Cubano, made the classic way, as well as a vegetarian Cubano. I got the classic with pork and an order of waffle fries. I knew going in that the sandwich was pretty massive, but I had forgotten that it is PACKED to the brim with perfectly seasoned pork. It hit the spot and satisfied my months-long Cuban sandwich craving. The fries were perfect. They were extra crispy and the generous serving was shareable.  The menu is limited, but what they do, they do well. I do wish that they had plantains on the menu, but you win some and you lose some. If you miss the old Bud's Broiler that used to be located here, they got you covered and have a burger on the menu. They also have an assortment of classic Cuban cocktails, but I didn't partake because it was a weekday at lunch and I had a job to get back to.

That's not to say I like absolutely everything on the menu, but this is the first restaurant I've ever been to where even for the dishes I didn't quite enjoy, I understood why the chef did what he did. Although I may have preferred something done differently, I was able to appreciate what the chef was trying to do and see why someone else may enjoy these flavors.   I like to cook, but I have no formal culinary cooking. My palate is above average, but hardly sophisticated. With every dish here though, my taste buds were taken on a journey of flavor. Nothing is wasted here. Every item on the plate serves some purpose and flavors interact beautifully.   For instance, the pickled vegetables plate came with kettle chips and a horseradish sauce. The sauce and the kettle chips offset the acidity of the pickled items perfectly.   On the crab dish, the garnishes interacted wonderfully with the perfectly spiced meat.  I was with a friend and we ordered a bunch of small plates to share. I was initially disappointed because I saw that the plates were really small and psychologically I felt that the small portions would lead to an underwhelming meal, no matter how delicious the food was. My feeling is that if I like something, I want lots more of it, and although the food here is delicious, the size of the small plates is not intended for sharing. I admit though, after sharing an appetizer plate, three small plates, and one entree, I was filled, even though I didn't not think I was.  Service is great and they give you new plates and silverware with each course.   The restaurant is part of the Saint Hotel so is smaller than I expected - basically it just occupies some space in the lobby. But it is tastefully decorated.

But really?! $10?! I rather have a jukebox! $10 can get you over 20+ songs of great music by professional artists...yeah I know it's the performance, but they weren't that good!)   Anyways, it was fun. They had the barber chair where you can pay I think $5-7 to get motorboat from the girl and get fireball poured into your mouth for less than 2 minutes.

The omelets were tasty, I loved the hash browns (the grits not so much, but thats the northerner in me perhaps!) and the lite menu (egg whites, turkey bacon.. it was a platter but I can't remember the name) was a hit with our family who were on a diet for the trip.

Then we both got scallops and swine with a butternut squash pur√©e and balsamic vinegar. All of the entrees sounded phenomenal, but we both couldn't resist getting that dish. The best part I have to say was the dessert. We got cafe au lait panna cotta with mini glazed donuts, which reminded us of beignets at cafe du monde.

Twice as much as it should. The rice plate wasn't any better. The meat was bland. They gave me brown rice even though I ordered white. And replacing the typical accompaniments was carrots and steamed broccoli. Such a disappointment. Such basic food messed up so badly, and it's not even fast. Really, no upside to eating here.

I will mention that you can make it spicier for $1, but I also want to ask why they charge a dollar for that. Also, it was too sweet for my taste, and that may be why I felt the sandwich was not that spicy. On the plus side, the chicken still managed to be well-cooked (crispy and not dry on the inside) even though it looked like they fried it beforehand and then would heat it up in an oven. Fair price for $8.  The cheese tots were okay. Not particularly crispy or crunchy, but they are generous with the cheese.  Pretty popular place so there was about a 10 minute wait for my sandwich to come out after ordering.

I asked for a little bit of rice with my quesadilla and I kid you not, they probably gave me ten grains. There is a reason it's so dang cheap.

She carries GREAT and affordable accessories and I love the sunglasses she carries, so much so that I currently am rotating 3 pairs.   Love that she supports other small business owners via trunks shows for various local jewelry, hat, purse makers. And, of course, Toulouse is a great shop ambassador.

I was so indecisive and they didn't make me feel rushed or silly at all.  I got the bowl with 2 proteins - salmon and tuna. Then got as much as I possibly could in the bowls! They do have brown and white rice and spring mix and like zucchini noodles to go as the base for the bowl.  They have this really good cucumber salad with rice vinegar to go into your bowl and so I got that with ponzu and chili paste. Y'all! Sooooooo good. I REALLY Loved my bowl! They have orange infused water which was wonderful and tasty. As we were leaving the girls asked us how everything was and really appreciated that we came in. It got kinda busy after we left and they do hVe some seating outside on Robert E. lee which is nice! I'm really glad they added this to the area.,Restaurants

I will start with the good: - blackened gator bites, tender with a tasty dipping sauce - good service even though we were a large group  The not so good: - crawfish fettuccine, the noodles were over-cooked and the alfredo needed some salt, that being said, there was a ton of crawfish in there - the gumbo was underwhelming, nothing bad about it but it wasn't something that wished there was more at the bottom of the cup  Great: The bananas foster desert was the best part of the meal.

1470,Justine,29.954052,-90.067173,4.0,"Had a disappointing experience. I have years of experience in the restaurant industry and understand the difficulty of opening a restaurant. I hope they can adjust a few things quickly at Justine.  First, our table was ready and we were sat quickly, and the hostess commented with a sigh of relief, ""At least your table is ready."" The ambience is very cool, and I love the vibe of the decor. We sat and about 10 minutes later we were greeted by our server. He was very pleasant and clearly experienced, but overwhelmed with how long drinks and food were taking for his tables.  We ordered a bottle of wine, and I thought the wine list was solid. Good choices in a range of prices.  We ordered the oysters en perseillade and bone marrow app. It took about 30 minutes to receive our appetizers. The oysters were cooked perfectly and my favorite dish of the night. The bone marrow was over cooked and the marrow was lost in the mashed potatoes, which were average potatoes. We sadly sent back the marrow, because we could not find any. If the marrow was laid to the side and cut differently, the dish could work.  For entrees, which took about 45 minutes after appetizers, we ordered the short ribs, spinach gratin, and shrimp en papillote. The short ribs and spinach were very good. The shrimp were raw, cold and brown. I had to send it back and obviously sending out raw food is not ok. Instead of putting it in another piece of paper and placing them back into the oven, they grilled the shrimp and did not cook the vegetables again that were in the paper with the raw shrimp. I sent it back a second time, because I did not order grilled shrimp and because of the vegetables. I assume the kitchen thought this was ok, but I was very excited to see this on the menu and would not have ordered grilled shrimp. This was the main reason I was disappointed, having a major problem with a main dish and not fixing it correctly. Food integrity should be important to a chef and his kitchen. Although a manager came by after the food was sent back, a manager should have dropped off the food the second time. I felt so bad for our server.  I ordered the mussels instead and they were typical mussels. We had the gateau for dessert and it was great.  I suggest waiting and let the kitchen work out the kinks before dining here. Also, be prepared to wait for your food on busy nights. From my view, the beef entrees are what work best. I sadly won't be returning.",Restaurants

Honestly, it looks a little sketchy from the outside... Don't let that scare you away. Inside it's warm and inviting. It's an order-at-the-counter type place, so you order at the counter (with the help of the giant menu boards), and they bring everything (even drinks) to the table. They brought out our salads first, then our pasta, which I liked. Service was quick and friendly!  Now for the food... It was pretty good! They were doing 50% off Small Plates, so my boyfriend and I both started out with the Caesar Salad, which was honestly not great. (There's no Parmesan or pepper on it!) The crouton was really tasty though, and I added Parmesan at the table. Not bad for being $3, though I might have been annoyed if I had paid $6. As for pasta, both of us did Make-Your-Own. (It's what made me want to come here in the first place.) I ordered the Rigatoni w/ Grandma's Bolognese (+ Italian Sausage). My boyfriend, who is Celiac and therefore gluten-free, got the Gluten-Free Fusili w/ Puttanesca (+ Gulf Shrimp). Overall, we loved and were really impressed by the housemade pasta. Both of us thought the sauces were really flavorful too, though if I returned I'd probably choose something less traditional. Boyfriend really, really liked the gluten-free pasta. It is, amazingly, housemade as well! (We found this out because Boyfriend liked it so much he asked what brand it was and they said they make it in the back. Nice!)  Overall, this is a great casual place with tasty food. I also really like the flexibility of the Make-Your-Own Pasta option. Seems like it provides a little something for everyone.

I know I sound like a broken (drunken?) record but, as they say, you write what you know and I know me a good wine bar dangit. Oak fits the bill when way up in the Riverbend.  The space is a departure from the smaller, darker wine bars that populate this city (and that I populate) and it's quite lovely. They somehow maintain this fairy light glow with the lightly-colored walls and furniture illuminated by pretty light fixtures. I'm gonna say it: a more feminine vibe, but that doesn't mean a man couldn't - and shouldn't - feel comfortable here.   And on that note, the crowd isn't primarily female, so there's that (calling all the single ladies). The crowd is very Uptown -grad student rather than the undergrad ubiquity at places like Monkey Hill and St. Joe's Bar (and Delachaise on weekends). Mature and polite young people for the most part and god, do I sound like my Great Aunt Tillie right now. Very different from the all-ages scene at my beloved Patrick's Bar Vin.  Staff is top notch at Oak! Although the place was bordering on very busy when we arrived, we were greeted and seated, but then opted for the circular bar that is awesomely situated in the middle of the room. Both bartenders were extremely friendly and attentive, even asked us if we wanted food. Sadly, I had just consumed enough Japanese food to feed a small village down the block at Chiba, so all I could do was admire the brief menu that promises tasty bites of exquisite things like frites and cheeses and olives. Oh and you small plate haters be rest-assured they have full entrees, too.  Wine list is as you'd expect: lengthy! I've been on a bubbles kick again and they've got 'em. A good selection of reds by the glass but definitely not as extensive as Delachaise & Patrick's. If vino ain't your thing, they have beer and a full bar.   One minor thing: not sure about the acoustics of the room. The band playing was just too loud for the otherwise delightfully hushed setting. A sound person would have rectified the situation (I could be wrong but it seems like the band did their own sound and that is never a good thing. Take it from someone who worked in the biz for years).  I'm looking forward to returning to Oak. I should remark that I came here on a Thursday night and it was the final frigid night of the week, yet it was still comfortably busy. Not sure if it's packed on the weekends, but I wouldn't be surprised, after all this is Oak St, quite the happening Uptown corridor.

The first 90 minutes are complementary if you're coming in to co-op and there are plenty of outlets throughout The Business Bar. After that your food & beverage spend is applied to the duration of your stay so if you munch and imbibe throughout your stay it all balances out.

2859,Republic NOLA,29.9440505,-90.0657171,5.0,"It's really hard to judge a music venue objectively, because almost undoubtedly the quality of the performance will influence your view of the space.  After experience an amazing show by Stars along with their ridiculously fun opening act Geographer, I was tempted to just give a blanket 5 stars to Republic just for booking them.  I was finally able to put on my objective glasses though.  THE GOOD  Intimacy:  What do I mean by that?  Well for anyone who hasn't seen a show at Republic yet, it's basically two floors with the second floor being a balcony that overlooks the main floor ""atrium"" area.  This atrium area is TINY, and by my best estimation could fit at most 200 people even when everyone is crammed together.  The benefit of this is that if you can secure a ticket to your particular show, it makes the entire experience really intimate even when the band is rocking out.  The people in the balcony are literally on top of the band, and even the people at the back of the atrium are only about 10-15 rows of people back from the stage.  It almost lends a, dare I say, element of exclusivity to all the shows there.  THE BAD  Acoustics:  So here's the problem.  Since it's such a small space, the main speakers have to be placed at awkward positions.  At least 4 of them hang directly above the first 3 rows of fans, and there are some poor souls in the balcony areas who are actually standing BEHIND the speakers.  I guess they get to enjoy their music experience via sound bounce-back from the walls.  You don't notice the bad acoustics as much when the bands play softer songs, but when they start to get amped up and play loud it sounds almost cacophonic.  What's worse, at the loudest levels you can barely hear the actual singing.  Bad acoustics, bad sound-checking.   PURGATORY  Not much to see here.  Moving on.  OVERALL  It's definitely worth seeing a show at Republic, iffy acoustics and all. I haven't gone to all that many concerts in my life, and all of them before this most recent one were at big venues.  If you're in the same boat as I was, trust me when I say the intimate atmosphere really makes for a fun concert experience.",Nightlife

Then the bartender starting luring Duncan in with treats while the vodka starting luring me.  I had a drink while my dog napped on the floor and got at least 5 treats out of the deal. The bartender, dressed in a purple LSU shirt, red bandanna around his neck, red Chucks and red Sally Jesse Raphael style glasses entertained everyone with his sarcasm, but even asked if there was anything in my shopping bags I would like to put in the frig while I had my drink (so sweet!). I stayed and watch the NBA game discussing basketball with the Celtics fan sitting next to me. Everyone was so friendly, I seriously talked to almost every person in there! The place was a riot, honestly I would've stayed for hours if I didnt have to walk all the way home! On the way out the bartender asked me if I was returning for their crawfish boil on Saturdays during Jazz Fest, I told him that I couldnt make it the first Saturday, but I would try to come in Friday later, he cuts me off with ""Hey, I'm not taking damn notes, we'll see you next time"" ahahahahah! I will SO return here! It was a blast!

The floors could use a deep cleaning, as well as the shelves and walls. Light bulbs need to be replaced. The cashiers are not talkative, but that is better than being surly or outright rude. The restrooms could stand a good scrubbing as well.  It is enough in a pinch, when you are in need of something and this is the closest thing nearby. They do not have a RedBox or propane here as some other Rite Aids do. Selection of inventory is limited, and every time I have come in, there have been stacks of boxes of inventory to be put out. For medical stuff, I suggest the Walgreens down the street. For alcohol, they are reasonably priced and usually fully stocked.

We were right on the side of the runway, sitting next to the judges, so we had one of the best views in the house as all of the fashion came down the catwalk.  Deborah and I had a good time doing some ""judging"" of our own and commenting on all of the designs. We both agreed that Brik Allen had the best looks and he ended up winning the design competition AND the Yelp people's choice competition! So, I guess we have some pretty good taste.  The one tiny bummer was that the food and drinks were a bit expensive, but it wasn't earth shattering because I didn't come to eat or drink.

Harold's a bit odd. We noticed that he tended to roam around the store a bit, but his encyclopedic knowledge of plants was very obvious and he was nothing less than personable. The whole experience had very much of a ""mom and pop"" experience, and it's very different than shopping at Home Depot or Lowes (and most of the other garden stores in the area).

Two weeks ago, my wife and I both ate Lux's burgers (I had the Lucy cheeseburger while she ate the Lux cheeseburger, with bacon and egg), and we were absolutely blown away by the service; fresh, hand-formed patties, and grilled to absolute perfection (bit of char, juicy inside, totally delicious) burgers; comfortable, attractive surroundings; just-right wait time for the cook to work his magic; and priced affordably in an ordinarily expensive tourist town. Today's return visit confirmed our first experience. I repeated the Lucy burger, while my wife tried their Philly Cheesesteak (shaved ribeye, and the owner suggested that she add a little steak sauce--WOW!). Once again, my cheeseburger was stellar. Oh! I forgot to mention earlier that the fresh toppings of shredded lettuce, sliced tomato, pickles, sauce, and two slices of cheese only added to the culinary experience of consuming our new definition of ""Best New Orleans Burger."" (We also enjoyed their peach and blueberry teas, and they serve some of the best--perfectly seasoned, crisp outside, potatoey inside--fries in the city.) - Dr Lee and Sue",Restaurants

Hungry and a little inebriated after a Saints' win on a Sunday and mulling over what to eat, my s.o. and I decided on Kebab.  The menu comes simple; usually a pork option, a chicken, and then a falafel which can be made vegan or just vegetarian. I'm a huge falafel fan so I ordered the falafel and the s.o. ordered the gyro. The kebabs come on a flat baked bread, which I actually prefer to a pita since they can hold up to all the dressings. My falafel came with a nice heaping portion of arugula, beets, hummus, and tzatziki. The falafel didn't taste fried and had lots of flavor, so I like to think that my meal here was healthy. I think I'll probably be ordering a meat option next time because I couldn't help myself from stealing bites of the gyro kebab which was covered in a cilantro sauce. We also ordered a side order of fries, which were okay. They're thick cut fries that don't have that much crunch to them, but they do come with an addicting garlic aioli. Both the meat option and the falafel tasted extremely fresh, yet filling.

3557,Original Sammy Seafood Restaurant,29.95845,-90.06612700000001,3.0,"I saw a Groupon for this place and bought it without realizing that I had seen this place before. The Groupon was for $40. I knew it wouldn't go a long way with the reviews I had seen, but what the heck.   I invited my boyfriend and another girlfriend of mine to come along.   My first disappointment came when we ordered two dozen oysters and our server returned to tell us they had run out. We also ordered the lobster with blackened steak  $40, BBQ shrimp appetizer $9, Crab cakes $12, fried shrimp platter $16, and three alcoholic drinks totaling $35. So it was expensive... and I was prepared for that.   I do not mind expensive prices, as long as it is worth it. The steak was very disappointing. We ordered is MEDIUM and it came back medium well. It was very dry and bland. I had to ad a whole lot of A1 sauce. I have never used A1 sauce because I've never had such a bland steak. So they lost major points for that. Also, I was not at all impressed with their BBQ shrimp appetizer. I've had much much better. And I'm obviously local so I have credibility when I say I've had better. There are way too many other places to get better BBQ shrimp to name.   It was overall okay. I probably wouldn't come back on my own, unless someone asked me to join a group. I certainly do not think the food is worth what the price is. I think it is a tourist trap since it is on Bourbon Street and tourists probably think that's real and authentic NOLA food. It kinda is, but certainly not the best. You can go to other great restaurants and pay the same price (which I won't mind) much muc better quality food. If I had to suggest something to this restaurant (as a business owner myself) I would lower the prices by 30-40%. Sell more volume and they'd probably even make more money.   I get asked a lot by tourists to recommend them a place to eat, since I have a shop in the French Quarter AND on Magazine Street, when I'm in the Quarter I have and never will recommend this place. If someone asks me how this place is, I would not recommend them at all, and evens lightly discourage it.   Not trying to be mean, just being honest. Trust me, if I were being mean I'd give them one star.. (Wish I could give them 2.5 stars and not 2).",Restaurants

I replied to him that I purchased it to use any day of the week and so on and so forth... he then consults with his manager in which she yells to take it this time but this is the last time she's accepting it?  So I'm puzzled and asking for an explanation from this kid that doesn't know what to say... at this point I'm expecting management to come over to explain her reasoning after I purchased the Groupon maybe 2 weeks prior to my visit...therefore after placing the order, we then cancelled the order in the next sentence solely based on how the overlystressed/overwhelmed manager responded by yelling to her staff that this is the last time without an explanation? Upon leaving waffles I stopped to speak to the manager and advised how myself nor my party were impressed by her reaction to trying to use the Groupon...she then states do you want your order or not?

1981,Booty's Street Food,29.964187,-90.04357399999999,16.0,"What a bummer! Being a resident of the Marigny and thrilled with the new restaurant scene developing in the Bywater, I was excited about the concept of this restaurant and so wanted to like it. First off, even if you'd never been to any of these places and sampled the street food the menu touts , I still think that the food is disappointing. Unfortunately, i have actually eaten a lot of the authentic street food abroad, and Booty's renditions don't even come close! Begging the question- have the chefs or owners of Booty's ever been to these places or do they just watch the Travel Channel a lot? However, the renovation is impressive and will even look better with l little age on it- ( if they can manage to stay open that long) and the drinks are interesting and fairly fun. I wish I could chalk the whole bad experience up to ordering badly, but two of the dishes that I ordered were on the recommendation of the server- the rice balls and the empanada. One quick note that must be said, the Ramen- really? egg noodles the size of fettuccine? and you call that pork broth? I'm pretty sure I cracked the code for that recipe- soy sauce, water and maybe a bit of sugar. As a lover of authentic Japanese Ramen, I was totally offended. Here's a little tip, his month's Bon Appetit  has a great photo of what real ramen should be, check it out boys, you don't even have to Japan! I could go on, but it would just be unnecessarily mean. Because I am the eternal optimist when it comes to new restaurants, especially those in my Hood, as disappointed as I am I will probably go back. The vibe was great and I would like to see them ultimately succeed, but next time I will stick to the fries and drinks.",Restaurants

I told her that was a hell of a way to run a business.  Her reply was, ""Don't curse at me!""  She then went into an explanation of how she could not control the suppliers.  Anne seemed totally unconcerned about having delayed my project for so long when I had paid for the whole piece in advance and she certainly did not seem concerned about not having my business in the future.

Iris excels in every area: food, drinks, service, atmosphere, location, music and overall graciousness. I made the reservation for 10-15 people, not knowing exactly how many in my party would show up. Iris pulled out all the stops to make sure everyone had comfortable seating and even prepared an overflow table for us. At no time did we feel jostled or rushed, which is a common fine dining concern.   The layout of the restaurant allowed diners to move freely to and from the table and to exchange seats as needed. The music selection was fun and unique, ranging from the Magnetic Fields to Johnny Cash. It was also quiet enough to be enjoyed while allowing conversation to flow unimpeded. Our waiter had excellent timing and anticipated our every need.   Though they don't have a full drink menu for lunch (I hear they have an amazing mixologist for the dinner hour) they do offer a selection of martinis and wines. One of the guests has accounts with several high-end bars in the Quarter, and the drink list passed his muster. Our table settled for Chardonnays, Perseco and chilled shots of Chartreuse, though I hear they have several types of absinthe as well.   Our group began with slices of warm, heavenly bread that Iris bakes in house. We continued with an assortment of salads--I had the Hollygrove arugula with warm goat cheese, ni√ßoise olives and balsamic vinaigrette. It was fresh perfection. A few of us opted for the mussels, which I heard were delicious. For my main course, I had a wonderful drum with onions prepared in a tangy soy reduction, which was an elegant complement for the fish. I also heard rave reviews about the gnocci and chicken.   All the entrees were creatively arranged and selected, and at no point did I feel overwhelmed or that any fuss or pretense had gone into the food. I also appreciated that the portions were European-sized (it always makes me laugh when other Americans list too-small portion size as a complaint even when the food is well-prepared!). Iris prepares a lot of their basic ingredients in-house, and I appreciate that the kitchen makes a point of incorporating gulf fish and produce purchased from local, farmer-friendly markets.   We settled on the prix fixe menu, which was $20 a person for appetizer, main course and the dessert of the day (the best strawberry sorbet I have had yet). With the added drinks and tip it came out to under $35 a person, which is an excellent price for such a delicious white-linen lunch.

The host recommended we have the Sunny Day drink, a delicious fresh mimosa style drink that was very reminiscent of a spiked orange julius. Then we had soy mochas, some of the better coffe we had on our whole trip, it was really good.    We ordered the Huevos Rancheros with no ham, and BELT Croissant sandwich without the bacon, both were really fresh and yummy!   Highly recommend this place for fresh juice, coffee, and breakfast.

On a whim I emailed the shop with a picture of the cross that i had taken when we were there. To my surprise they still had it! Everyone there was incredibly helpful in the process as this time I was determined to get the necklace for my wife. We worked it out and it was shipped to me quickly after.

The place was fairly empty at 1 on a Friday and we were lead upstairs. Honestly, there's not much going on up there and it was a bit warm, but we decided to stick it out. Everything on the menu looked great and I decided to get the Catfish Acadian, which is catfish topped with crawfish and sauce with a side of vegetables. My dad got the pork chop.  My dish was great! I have no idea what was in the sauce but it was delicious and it was a perfect pairing with the fish. The vegetables were also really good; they were nicely cooked and fresh. My dad wasn't overly blown away by his pork chop, so if you find yourself here you might want to stick to the seafood.  Bria was our waitress and she was wonderful! She was attentive, kept the fresh iced tea coming and she was extremely personable. She was probably the highlight of the visit.  I'm not sure if I would go back. The food was good, but the atmosphere left something to be desired and I feel like I can get good catfish at plenty of places without going out of my way.

The crab cake was good, the card at salad was decent, however they overcooked my filet and it lacked so much seasoning that I dipped it in the creamed spinach for flavor. The mash potatoes were mediocre at best. We finished with the cheesecake,  blueberry cheesecake. It was a cheesecake dredge in blueberry compote. The cheesecake was soft, room temperature and ""whipped"". Not the typical cheesecake. The Graham cracker crust was good but could have been better.   So many options to eat in New Orleans.

SP is one of the few stores in the city where you can get almost all special release shoes during a release like yeezy boosts and many jordan brand items, but like I said before, it would be through a raffle system, so you'd have to be lucky.

It was cooked to perfection and the meat was very tender and flavorful. This meal came with the Kale salad and mashed potatoes as well, but you could get the spinach or other vegetable if you prefer.  My spouse ordered the Hawaiian Rib Eye and said it was the best they had ever had. Tender, juicy and full of flavor. This meal came with mashed potatoes as well.  I had the Center cut steak, and I get mine well done. This is the most tender steak I have ever had.

A mimosa should be mostly sparkling and topped w/ juice. I asked if he could add more but his adjustment made no difference.

You know, the way they're supposed to be made.  Clearly there's no front-of-house manager to oversee and ensure good service.  Food-wise, it's meh.

I got in touch with the owner and she pretended that she couldn't figure out who was working there that day. Really??? At your restaurant? Ok. She offered me a small credit to go back for another meal but I never went back. I had spent $10 to $12 in that place. What a joke. They probably wouldn't have known how to honored the credit anyway so I didn't waste my time.",Restaurants

When the dress came in though, I thought I had ordered the wrong color and was so distraught! The staff did everything they could including sending me emails and checking with the designer to see if I could switch the dress out. They were very helpful and super sweet about everything even though I was, admittedly, kind of rude about the whole ordeal because of my stress level pre wedding. I would highly suggest going to Wedding Belles for all your bridal needs. The ladies who work there are talented, helpful, and so so nice.",Shopping

The Satchmo Summerfest is a great event for everyone--including the kids.  During the Festival, the organizers offer educational lectures to the public, which chronicle the life and success of Louis Armstrong.  There are also food stands which serve classic New Orleans fare, and most importantly, the organizers make sure there is great music playing at every second.  There are multiple stages surrounding the old U.S. Mint where you can sit (or dance) in the shade and enjoy an alcoholic beverage and the sound of blaring music.  This year, the Festival coincided with the Napoleon exhibit in the old U.S. Mint, so the organizers gave the Festival-goers free admission to see the Napoleon-era relics that had come into town.  Simply put, great festival, at a great price.  :)",Nightlife

After 30 min a waitress approached us and asked us if we had been waited on, we said no, and she said she wasn't sure if we were her table, she left and came back 10 min later and apologized and said she was our waitress.  We ordered drinks and off she went, 10 min later she was back with drinks, Be aware you will pay for water, 2.00 per bottle.  The bloody mary $14.00 was drinkable but nothing special.

The rest of the food was simply not good.  We had purchased a groupon for this place and that included a dessert and so we ordered the bread pudding, again it was horrible, it was tough and rubbery.

He even told me to contact the owner that he would tell me the same thing.  I have yet to do so but im curious as to what his response will be.

The Millennial Awards was a packed crowd and I wished the food stations had been set up a little better, but there is only so much you can do with limited space.

The main room where the awards were held was very nice. I sat upstairs and there was another bar there that was less crowded, so that was nice.

They were busy and getting everything done, but they weren't rude or frazzled, and I had a real sweet waitress.  I ordered the fried shrimp po boy dressed, and asked for a side of rebbeans instead of fries.  I almost had second thoughts on that because the burgers that they were cooking right in front of me looked and smelled so good.  I really have a difficult time resisting the grill.

One of my dogs has severe seizure issues and is on 3 medications to control them. Two of the medications I get directly from the vet, one I have to get from a human pharmacy- diazepam. This particular location is so inconsistent on how they fill it, is unbelievable. I can't request a refill online, through the app or the automated phone service. I actually have to call and speak to a person. I understand that this is a controlled substance and an ID needs to be shown to pick it up. Sometimes they ask to see my ID, sometimes they don't. Sometimes I can give the ID number over the phone and they'll fill it and ask to see it when I pick up. Sometimes they don't ask for the ID at any point. Today I tried calling in a refill as my dog had a pretty epic seizure this morning and I was running low on the diazepam (the one medication that actually stops active seizures). I waited on hold for over 10 mins to speak to someone. I was then told that they couldn't refill over the phone as they needed to see my ID. I asked if they could fill it and I'd show my ID when I pick it up- nope, not this time. Doesn't matter that they've done it in the past, I now have to go in, request the refill, show my ID and wait.

All for $9, a price I will happily pay for something I would never make at home. I also ordered the house greens on the side ($3), which were cooked and seasoned well with a vinegary taste and pork hock. My boyfriend said they tasted like the greens he used to eat in North Carolina.  The deliciousness of the mussels tied with the sweet potato croquettes ($7). They were so amazingly crispy on the outside and soft and buttery on the inside. The pairing of a salted plum jam was SO delicious and inspired. Even my boyfriend liked it and he usually hates jams and jellies.  The only item that didn't impress us as much was the pork and bacon terrine ($9). I thought it had a good flavor, similar to andouille. In the restaurant's defense, it may just be that I don't care for terrine. I liked it a lot more than the texture of pate (more similar to sausage), but wasn't a big fan of the cold chewiness. My boyfriend who is a big charcuterie nerd liked it less than I did. But if you are a terrine fan in general, you would probably enjoy it.  Bonus points for our friendly and accommodating server.

They pour short, which is obviously a HUGE issue. There is an internet Juke box, which I believe is the WORST invention to ever plague a bar. There is Waaaaay to much plastic being used here, not much glass, which again is just lending to the automated inhuman feel of the place.      Seeing that it is walking distance to my place, I shall frequent here now and again. I am sure I will become known by their kitchen staff.

1456,Sterling Silvia,29.960289399999997,-90.0592069,18.0,The last time I was in New Orleans I went into this shop while my husband was at Turtle Bay having a beverage or two.  I was on a mission to find a new wedding band for my husband.  We fell in love in New Orleans and wanted to find something that represented New Orleans.  I found what I wanted there.  Everyone was great.  Silvia took care of me and  introduced me to everyone in the shop.  During the day I went back 3 times and bought something every time.  I always get compliments on my jewelry and I let everyone know where I bought it and how great everyone is there.  I will be back in New Orleans next week and my first stop will be there!!!  So I highly recommend that if you are in New Orleans it is a must!!! If you can't make it to New Orleans then check out there website.,Shopping

620,Ma√Øs Arepas,29.941898300000002,-90.0750378,3.0,"Okay let start by saying that ""for New Orleans"", there's no other place like it. It's Colombian. Not Mexican. (Which sways towards cheesy and TexMex) This place is what you'll find in Miami, New York, DF or Cartagena. The decor is chic yet earthy. I can even go as far as saying that I see a reflection of myself in the ambiance. Now let's talk about the food. I'm not one to give a great assessment on what Colombian should be but I liked it a lot. I had the arepa sampler and the chorizo arepa- both which I devoured. Each arepa had its distinct taste and I wanted more. My only drawback of the whole ordeal was that I so know arepa to Colombians, as is what hot dogs are to Americans, or tacos to Mexicans. For an appetizer and one arepa I paid $30(tip not included) and to me, that's ""fine dining"" prices. The rock in my shoe was that those plaintain chips served as a side item to the arepa, were unmistakably ""Zambos plaintain chips""(cheap Honduran bag plaintain chips). I don't have a problem eating them but for $13 an arepa I'm definitely being ripped off. Please slice and fry me a real plaintain chips, don't cop-out with the cheap stuff! That arepa plate served as is should be no more than $9-$10. It wasn't filling at all-for Colombian street food this place is a little steep. If another place opens up that serves the same with lower prices, you guys are gone-pecan. Other than that, this place is solid. If you're thinking about going, please try it out. Worth going once.",Restaurants
64,CVS Pharmacy,29.9406,-90.1042,17.0,"This particular location of CVS is right on the corner of Napoleon and South Claiborne, near Ochsner Baptist Hospital.  Products: What you might typically find at any of these big box pharmacy chains---OTC medicines, Rx medicines, beauty products, supplements, photography accessories, snacks, etc. There are usually well-stocked, and their prices not unreasonable. 3 stars  Service: The management has definitely imparted the importance of the greeting when a customer enters the establishment. There's at least one cashier working at any time, but sometimes 2 during busier times, a security guard is almost always present, some pharmacy staff in the back, and they have ""doc-in-a-box"" service available for those requiring quick, non-emergency care. 3 stars  Facilities: A typical brick-and-mortar, flattop building you'd expect from this chain. There is ample private lot parking, and a drive through for the pharmacy. The major issue I've noted with the outside is the trashcan is not emptied often enough. Other than that, the exterior is quite nice. The inside is aisled, with the medical services in the rear. There is nothing really remarkable to say about the interior. It's usually tidy, though. 3 stars  Overall: This is a regular stop for me when I require a pharmacy. There is a Walgreen's across the street that's typically filled with all sorts of riffraff I try to avoid if I can. If you're in this area, go here instead. 3 stars",Shopping

This seems a bit odd since people can sit next to it and rest their head on the wall, but it is a very cool painting.  The bar feels very fancy, because of the history surrounding it, but doesn't feel pretentious. I think I would be comfortable here dressed up, or in casual clothes.

They want to get you your food as soon as possible without stinching on quality. That's partly what I like about it. They work like a well-oiled machine, but they're sorta laid back at the same time.   My usual? The Sam sandwich with an Abita Root Beer. Pastrami, swiss, russian dressing, and cole slaw on rye (if you want it) bread served hot with a kosher pickle on the side. It's absolutely one of the most delicious sandwiches I've ever tasted.

It's the kind of service where you're praying to see someone on the wait staff so you can get a drink refill because you finished your drink 15 minutes ago.    Food-wise, I got the breakfast fried rice, and my shrimp were so salty they were inedible--I actually had to spit the first one into my napkin.  My partner's shrimp, on the other hand, had no salt (how does this happen?!), and one was uncooked.  I did not (and frankly COULD NOT) eat my meal because of the salt issue.  The three other people at my table tried a bite of my meal and were similarly shocked by the salt.  None of us has never experienced something this ""off"" in a meal.  It went way beyond the ""it's a little salty"" to ""holy crap I might be sick because something is so wrong with what I just took a bite of.""  I politely told the waitress that she may want to let the cook know something was wrong with the salt level, and she said she was sorry and would let the manager know.  Then I got the bill and the shrimp were still on the tab, no one offered us even a free slice of pie or said ""Hey sorry you paid $94 for brunch and two of the four people couldn't eat their food,"" nothing.  I don't like giving a bad review on here, but I felt like I'd been taken advantage of or scammed almost.    I wish this place were even moderately good because it's so close to my house, but I just can't do it again.  I will not return, and I would not recommend this restaurant to a friend.

Everyone was complaining regulars were stating this was the last time after 10 years.  This was like a poorly done Wedding buffet where they totally misjudged the amount of food, gave out reservations (did not honor them) and had taken your credit card to charge you if you did not show.  I have never seen more unhappy patrons.  There were still 50 people waiting to be seated when the Brunch closed and they were starting to pck up the food....

I would think the popularity of those 4 items should have been pretty easy to predict but then again I'm sure I would have made other mistakes.  In terms of the burgers, they're pretty good.  I ended up with a venison burger on my first visit cooked medium rare and it was just about right - and the key is that it was still juicy which of course will often be an issue with lean game meats.  The brioche bun was very good and other than the burger being over-seasoned it was medium thickness, seemed to be good quality meat, and tasted pretty good.  Of course, it was $0.25 each to add lettuce and tomato then another $1.00 to add avocado then another $2.00 to upgrade from chips to onion rings then with a drink added the total bill came to almost $16.  For one person.  I mean, it was a pretty good burger and the homemade onion rings were nice but I could have gone to Wendy's for half the price and gotten a burger that satisfied similarly.  Charcoal's actually makes Tru Burger look cheap which isn't easy and it almost makes The Company Burger appear under-salted which also ain't easy.  I still haven't had a great burger in NOLA - give me Michael Symon's burgers any day from B Spot and Bar Symon.  I've also had much better burgers in my previous residences of Portland and Chicago - and they cost less even at sit-down restaurants.  For these prices I want the best and I'd prefer if Charcoal's had a menu of 5-10 great combinations rather than making customers choose all the ingredients for every burger served.  Certainly, I may stop by Charcoal's occasionally but I don't expect it to be a habit.  Wow, it's now an hour after I ate my burger and I can still taste the salt on my tongue...",Restaurants

I did and then came back the next night for a second meal. This is unual for me to do while I am in New Orleans as I like to eat my way across the city. The first night I had the Roasted Portuguese Sardines, While this is not a dish for everyone their preparation was excellent and all that was left on my plate were the head and tails. They were seasoned and roasted to perfection. As my entr√©e I chose the Trout Campfire with fingerling potato fried egg and lemon butter. A dangerous preparation because if it is not watched carefully it is easy to overcook the fish - mine was perfect.  My only letdowns were with the white wines that were available by the glass.  I tried several white wine offerings and found them weak and tasteless. The white wines were not up to the standards of the food. I also did not have desert as they were sold out of one of my choices and the other choice was not yet prepared. But I came back the next day for meat.  The second night I started with the House Charcuterie Board (YUM!) and a glass of Spanish Tempranillo (a nice wine). I chose the Beef Short Ribs Bourguignon with buttermilk spaetzle and farm vegetable as my entr√©e (YUM YUM). Thus was a hearty robust flavorful dish that evoked memories eating the one of those special out of the way restaurants that one sometimes finds in France.  It was French comfort food at its best. I paired this with a glass of the Cote du Rhone.  Both of the red wines were quite good and complemented the food - much better than the whites I had the previous night. The desert - creme brulee- was good and I paired it with a medium dry sherry. A good meal.   The staff were all great and well trained and contributed to a wonderful experience both nights.  I will eat here next time I am in New Orleans because there are many appetizers, and entrees choices that I would love to try. This is a winner!

The atmosphere is modern and tasteful, dark, cool, and pleasant, though the design seems to be trying a little too hard for cool.  That's not really a bad thing; it's endearing rather than offensive (If it matters, they seem to have gotten the music thing under control.  Again, it's more funny than off-putting).  If you can't be bothered to read the whole review, I'll give you the takeaway message right now: order a big Sapporo draft (or Kirin Ichiban if that's your thing) and a couple or three of the small plates.  You will enjoy it.  Bring friends so you can trade bits of the appetizers.  If you're still hungry, order some of the killer noodles.  Maybe the sushi's good, maybe it isn't.  I haven't bothered to find out because the rest of it is great.  Detail-wise: the gyoza are rich, redolent little pockets of juicy flavor that come with a great citrus sauce for dipping.  It's not the overpowering raw soy flavor most places give you.  The takoyaki are intriguing, with an internal texture that's somewhere between a pancake and a set custard, spiked with bits of meaty, chewy octopus and topped with the deep ocean funk of katsuoboshi.  The seaweed salad is redolent of sesame oil and has a satisfying crunch.  Also, try some of the fried skewers.  I got the pork, which was crunchy on the outside and came with tonkatsu sauce, which is sort of what you'd get if barbecue sauce and ketchup gave birth to a talented and delicious child.  I can't imagine that they're any less talented at skewering and frying (or grilling) other things.  And if you're still hungry, there are noodles in abundance, and good noodles.  The ramen, if you're used to packets, will be revelatory (though it's not the best I've ever had, I eat it happily).  It's rich and filling, coming in head-sized bowls.  Even better is the yakisoba, a hot fried noodle dish that came out steaming and savory, with the meaty, slightly charred flavor that would, in Chinese cuisine, be called wok hee.  It's like what you wish lo mein could be.  The food's great, the beer is cold and appropriate to the food.  There are even karaoke rooms you can rent.  What's not to like?",Restaurants

What I'm learning about cigar bars is you have three kinds- the cigar shops that allow you to smoke in a small area that's secondary to their purpose, the high end cigar bar that is more of a jacket and dress up type place to sip wine and enjoy a puff, and the casual lounge style cigar bar where you can play darts or pool and it's a much more relaxed atmosphere.  Dos Jefes is the latter - a low key lounge with a large bar area where you can listen to live music, a back area with a pool table, slot machines, and an outdoor area as well.   You can make an evening out of this bar or just stay until you finish your cigar.

The food was delicious, better than any other Creole place I've tried, it seems worth the full menu price. We also shared a Voodoo Juice which tasted pretty good and felt kind of strong. The only thing we had wished is if there was a side salad option. Unfortunately the meal was too large for my girlfriend and our hotel didn't have a fridge and microwave so a lot went to waste.  For dessert, the server (Cliffton I believe) had given us a complimentary bread pudding and we ordered a key lime pie, both to go.

My girlfriend ordered a 8 piece tradition buffalo wings. Now I won't even mention the terrible service or inattentiveness of the staff there, nor will I dedicate this complaint to the fact that her traditional wings were pitifully small (some were only 3/4 the size of a lighter). No this complaint is dedicated to the despicable quality of my jalapeno pineapple wings. It literally was so burnt on the bottom I could lift up the entire contents of the box by pinching any section of the mass. The chicken tasted like it was reheated at least once and it wasn't even warm when I got it. Now even worse, the staff refused to refund the balance of my half of the order onto my card. Can you believe they charged us $27 for these 2 orders of wings and 2 drinks and 2 extra blue cheeses (which I gave back)?

2423,Casa Pelican B&B and Cooking School,29.953474600000003,-90.04853809999999,18.0,"We visited New Orleans for a week recently, and had the pleasure to stay with Chef Karen at her B&B. We also took advantage of the opportunity to  take two of her cooking classes.   The cooking classes: Chef Karen isn't just a great cook, she is an excellent teacher. Her classes are as hands-on as you're willing to make them. Her stated goal is to demonstrate and then step away from the kitchen. Your group of 4-8 students will do all of the prep work and then rotate through the actual cooking of multiple local classics. Chef Karen will guide you through the steps, and explain exactly what you're doing and why. She will describe not only what you are looking for as you cook, but also what you are tasting and smelling for! My wife and I have already prepared an authentic jambalaya since our return home, with the recipe and skills we learned in Chef Karen's kitchen. We felt truly prepared by her teachings. I would unreservedly recommend her classes if you get to New Orleans and can spare one afternoon/evening for an immersive experience.  The B&B: A charming home in the Algiers Point neighborhood, just across the river from the French Quarter, Casa Pelican has two bedrooms available for rental. Our room was comfortable and homey, with our own bathroom. The air conditioning was a wonderful counter to the 90+ degree summer heat. Breakfasts were homemade, delicious, and plentiful. The best thing about the place, though, is Karen. She is the warmest and friendliest person, and she opens her home to her guests as if they are friends, not just customers. She is so willing to engage with you in conversation, and she is a fount of information about the area, the culture, and of course the food.   We found this situation to be terrific, but I think it wouldn't necessarily be right for everyone. Some small caveats: - As mentioned on their listing, Case Pelican is an older house with a relatively steep and narrow stairway up to the bedrooms. It wasn't a problem at all for us, but if you aren't comfortable getting your bags up a narrow flight of stairs, this might be a problem. - It's not difficult to get from Casa Pelican to the French Quarter, but it is about a ten minute walk to the ferry (a five minute ride) and then a few minutes to get into the SW edge of the FQ.  (The ferry runs every 30 minutes until 9:45pm midweek and 11:45 on weekends.) Totally doable, but it means it's not convenient to drop back to the room midday for a rest, or in the evening to shower and change before you head to a nice dinner. It also means you're going to have additional walking on both ends of your day.  With that in mind, I have to say that my wife and I feel like now we have a great friend in New Orleans and we really couldn't imagine heading back there and NOT staying at Casa Pelican with Chef Karen. And head back there we will.",Shopping

These are not the same old tired masks you can find literally everywhere else in the Quarter; the masks here are crafted by local artisans, and they're exquisite.

The masks here are closer to what you'd find in a shop in Venice (Italy, not California!), in terms of style and quality.  The young man behind the counter (I'm pretty sure his name is Daniel) was truly welcoming and friendly, a representation of the best kind of hospitality and class that New Orleans has to offer.  If you're coming to NOLA for the first time (like I was) or the fifty-first, this is one place you need to check out!

My burger was EXCELLENT and the tomato was absolutely awesome!  While the French toast was flavorful, it was a little soggy for my tastes, but my daughter liked it.   While talking with the owners we found out they were from Detroit and so is her grandfather and they had REAL hot dogs from Detroit, so I had to take two to go.  I asked for them raw simply because I knew he would want to cook them himself and he went on and on about them and how good they are.  I am a native NYer and when I asked them if they had any white coney's they said sadly no, they did not, as they were from Detroit and white coney's are only from NY.  It made me happy though, because they knew what I was talking about.  I have been to several ""hot dog restaurants"" and they have no idea what a white coney is and you can NOT get one anywhere in the city unfortunately.

A couple of months later, we received a very disgruntled email from Jessyka about how she had to leave the company due to many reasons and just wanted to let her clients know that she was available to talk through anything necessary to make the transition better for our events.  After that, there was quite a bit of trouble with the new rep on behalf of the owner. My emails and calls weren't answered or returned and when I went to the restaurant a month before my wedding to try to work out details, I was told I needed to make an appointment. After about 20 minutes, they agreed to just go ahead and meet with me then.  Three weeks before the wedding, I received a phone call stating that even though we had a signed contract that promised 135 chairs, they would only be able to accommodate us if we paid a fee of $400-500.   My fianc√© pushed back on the terms of the signed legal contract. She then said we would have the chairs and they would make it work.   The day before my wedding the rep called and said that they were ordering less chairs because the space wasn't big enough to accommodate my guests and that 30 of them will have to stand in the back of the room.  The night of the rehearsal dinner, I was reminded that my dog wasn't written into the contract after being told that she was allowed to walk in the wedding.  It was a stressful and unfortunate lead up to the wedding, but the ceremony itself was beautiful and perfect. The space was great, we ended up getting all of our chairs at no additional charge and they even set up a really nice area in the courtyard for formal photos before the ceremony.  Would I recommend? Probably not. But our wedding couldn't have been more perfect in the end.",Restaurants

Steve has always been a gifted guitarist, and it isn't hard to find him booked to play these days (look for Hollyrock or The Ice Man Special - both are playing in Oakdale on Thanksgiving eve, 2016).  Steve's shop, International Vintage Guitars, has inventoried many rare, hard to find, and highly desirable guitars (and amplifiers, effects, etc.) for decades.  He must be some kind of wizard to find them, but he keeps digging up incredible guitars (check his FB page where he occasionally posts new and exciting instruments: https://www.facebook.com/stephen.staples.505).  Steve is a virtual walking encyclopedia of knowledge on guitars, equipment and the music of our generation (and a couple of prior generations), and it is always fun to hear what gem will share next.

The sales person who assisted me was very solicitous and helped me figure out the dressing room situation.  Seriously the store is going to explode from stock.  This store probably had the greatest number of formal gowns, but some of them seemed to date from 1984; so if I was drag queen, it would have been perfect.

We then remembered seeing the place on FoodNetwork's 'Diners Drive-In and Dives'.  My oh my, they weren't kidding when they named it ""America's Best Fried Chicken""!  I had the Fried Chicken Salad and Homemade Lemonade.....BEST FC indeed! Of course it was boneless in the salad, it had a soft as butter feel when bitting into it and the spice had a small kick to it. The crust was so flaky yet not crumbly, and was not at all chewy like I find others to be. The greens were a nice complement to the chicken. All together it was a perfect meal for a considerably warm N.O. day. Oh and the Lemonade! A little sweet for my pallet, but nothing a little water couldn't fix. Once I poured a bit into it, it was God made goodness in liquid form! You could really taste the lemons in it which I really appreciated.  Two of my peers had the FC with Mac n' Cheese & Peas, and they could simply explain it as love on a plate. The third had the Catfish and she devoured it faster then we could get to half our plates. Now, I'm not a fish-eater so I didn't care for the texture though the meat was really good. It seemed to have the same spice as the FC and it didn't taste fishy at all.   We also had a couple of Corn Bread muffins...(Which I'm normally not a fan of either)...They were so soft and fluffy and not at all mushy or dry which always seems to be a turnoff with other corn breads. And the very last thing we all shared (it was a pretty big plate) was Butter Beans. I've never before had them and can only describe them as beans in its own gravy. Though that might not seem very appetizing it really was amazing!  The service was very pleasant and the wait wasn't very long at all. It had a almost homey feel to it even though there isn't much of a theme to the place. And the workers were super kind and sweet.

No offense to the employees here (who are all very nice, by the way), but everything about this particular Goodwill makes me feel really cheap and used like a dirty condom from Family Dollar. The building itself is incredibly large, and next door is some sort of program for people who have EBT and don't have any clue in the universe how to apply for a job. Most of the clothes are women's, but that's alright because I occasionally wear women's pants. All of the clothes are extremely trashy looking, like the kind you find in a dumpster during a dangerous stroll through the St. Roch neighborhood (because we all do that for fun). I once found a lovely pair of women's burgundy wine corduroy pants that fit me like a prince and only payed $3 for them. I suppose that is the point of Goodwill. It's trashy, but if you are lucky enough to find something good, it's going to be incredibly cheap.   I typically like rummaging through the LP section at thrift stores because this is where I find piles of classical and opera records for 50 cents a piece. However at this Goodwill, all of the records are either missing from their sleeve, scratched like an ex-girlfriend would your car, or broken. I also make a habit out of finding lost gems within the piles of books, but this Goodwill has a terrible selection of books that only your grandmother would read. The book area is huge, but yeah, don't get too excited.   In order to find the true gems when thrift store shopping, you really have to know HOW to thrift store shop. I've found the occasional bookcase for $10, but you have to peak your head in every other week or so to check on the new arrivals. I live walking distance from this Goodwill, so I do just that. Every blue moon I'll spot a dainty looking vintage chair, refurnished and incredibly affordable. Also, the glassware section may perhaps be the best part of this particular Goodwill. One may find a set of handsome vintage glassware on a good day. I always patrol the thrift stores for old absinthe glasses that they don't know are absinthe glasses, and sometimes run across lovely sets of vintage wine glasses, cocktail glasses, and glass cups. So take it from a professional thrift store shopper: this isn't the place for a new wardrobe, but you're sure to find the occasional gem in the furniture area or the glassware section if it's your lucky day.",Shopping

It's a newer restaurant from John Folse, located in the Royal Sonesta Hotel, not far from Bourbon street.  The ambiance was lovely and inviting, with nice touches from unique light fixtures to a little ""ottoman"" for holding your purse.  The food was well thought out and delicious.  We started with a charcuterie board...it was just meat, no cheese.  There were all sorts of sliced meats, as well as terrine, pate and pickled veggies, with some mustard and other sauces on the side.  The meats were good; it was a nice start.  I then indulged in a half dozen of the oysters on the half shell R'evolution style.  They were so fresh and tasty.  Two of them had a tangerine salsa, another two had lime granita and the others were simply decorated with parsley or something.  They were all very tasty, especially the ones with lime granita.  No cocktail sauce is needed for these.  For my entree, I had the homemade ribbon pasta with crab and leeks.  It was so savory and the perfect meal for someone who doesn't want a heavy dish.  You can really tell a difference in fresh homemade pasta from the dried pasta...it's so delicious.  I ordered the gruyere potatoes au gratin as a side...yum!  Those were some tasty layered, cheesy potatoes.  My husband had the orange molasses duck with turnips and prunes.  It was different, but in a pleasant way.  For dessert, we had the coffee and beignets.  The coffee being, mocha pots de creme.  It was served with black fig jam, which I tried, but decided to ignore.  I liked the beignets simply with the pot de creme.  Service was attentive, when they were around, but it was a slower paced meal in general.  I look forward to (hopefully) getting to eat here for a special occasion next time I'm in New Orleans. :)  Even their bar menu sounds fantastic!",Restaurants

539,La Vie En Rose Cafe,29.9398338,-90.07975108459999,18.0,"Words cannot even describe the essence and quality of La Vie En Rose Cafe. If you read no further, just hear this: this cafe is a gem, from drinks to service to ambiance, it is so special and you would be doing yourself a favor to visit!  (food + drink review first, overall review below) I ordered their signature ""La Vie En Rose Latte"" hot. The latte was beautiful, and had the perfect amount of sweetness to make it enjoyable. A nice, palatable drink, without any stark flavors that might put one off.   If you're looking for a super sweet refresher, I recommend the ""Hibiscus Punch"" which is a mixture of hibiscus tea, lemonade, and vanilla (best part). The flavors are so beautifully paired with the vanilla adding a nice unique profile, and of course it comes iced so perfect for a summer day.   For food, there are an array of pastries served. I had the almond croissant, which was fresh and delicious. However, don't be disappointed if you are looking for a hot meal or full menu. This place does the drinks right, and offers some tasty snacks to pair.  Now, the holistic experience: Visiting New Orleans for the summer, I have sought out coffee shops and cafes a plenty, but I was so fortunate to stumble upon this cafe by accident. Two ladies exiting urged me to go inside when I arrived, and I immediately understood why. Walking in takes your breath away, as you uncover a magical world inside. Entirely unsuspecting, I was too giddy to order at first and had to explore. The cafe is owned by a beautiful woman, Kirby, and is run at the storefront. In partnership with a Neon Art collective, the space is filled with neon art and displays, as their workshop lies at the back.   I was in awe when entering because you are immediately surrounded by bright lights, beautiful colors, and honestly dope displays. This coffee shop-meets-neon art space is genius. You literally are sitting in art, and I will say it is probably the best overall interior I have ever seen.  Now, I cannot write this review without remarking on owner, Kirby. She runs the cafe with the most positive energy, and creates a quality experience. To see a woman of color owning and running such a stellar business was refreshing and inspiring, and (especially being in New Orleans) her inclusion of Creole heritage/traditions in the cafe's story and even the menu made me  more eager to support.  She crafted each beverage herself, and was so attentive to all customers. Perhaps most important, the atmosphere. Of course the aesthetic of neon lights and fixtures in addition to beautiful music made this place feel unearthly. But the environment of comfort, glee, and community was even more evident in the customers themselves. Many gathered to share conversations with friends or loved ones, and even strangers connected (myself included). It felt natural  to spark a short conversation with those sitting around you, and pleasant exchanges were abundant.   Overall, I suppose I can't express enough how unique and amazing La Vie En Rose is. The menu items were stellar, the service was splendid, and looking around to enjoy the neon art was perhaps the most exceptional component. Even just being in the company of others and enjoying the spot on a rainy day felt like an escape. It was an uplifting experience, beyond a simple coffee shop. Truly special.",Restaurants

I'd just moved here and hadn't really established a system of  care yet... so a quick google search of esthetician's in the area led me to Queendom. I called and the spoke to the owner Melissa and she told me to come in right away so she could have a look. She took one look at my skin and told me EXACTLY what was going on, gave me a small sample of her bar soap and I purchased one. It was so soothing and calmed my skin within 2 days time.

The brisket is best when dipped in the Guasacaca (avocado based salsa) which lends a brightness to the rich brisket.   After, we tried the seafood paella which was full of seafood and sausage.    Everything was tasty, though the buffet suffers some due to the lack of traffic as the temperature on some dishes wasn't ideal.  This is anecdotal, but deserves mentioning.    We did speak with the owner after eating and he shared his background.  He couldn't have been nicer, and did allow us to try a few items off the day's menu (the empandas are not to be missed).   Calypso is a great addition to River Ridge, but helps fill the hole of Latin cuisine in the entire metro area.  I can't wait to get back and try more of the menu!

The pizza is pretty good - not the best in the city (slice or PD), but much better than your domino's or the nearby dough bowl (an less saturated with drunk 18 year olds).

As for those who have had unfriendly experiences, keep in mind that Candice, the owner and designer, has extensive experience with the European market and models the store after the European (especially Parisian) style of shopping. The salesladies aren't there to be chummy and will not give you much attention unless it appears that you are serious about a purchase or about putting an outfit together. Then they will give you their undivided attention and suggest ways of pairing garments and accessories. They will not lie and tell you something fits when it doesn't. They will, however, make sure they do whatever is needed to make the piece look right for you, including finding the right size, helping you lace a corset or shoes, or running to the back to get stays or pins.  They did just that when I went in for my wedding outfit. I also appreciate that they gave me ample time to examine every piece. Their no-exchange policy is strict, but if you're seriously going to pay $450 for a dress, you are allowed to take your time and examine it in thorough detail. You might drop some serious cash in a visit, but you will feel and look amazing--and you will wear these numbers time and time again (and yes, men and women alike *will* complement you). Their line is the ultimate in classy, sexy elegance!",Shopping

I tend to go on week nights as the crowd is weak and the service is excellent!  I love going to this location because you get the white linen with the cafeteria price!  It's relaxed and very casual and yet cozy.  The dining area is this huge open space, very reminiscent of an American cafe in NYC.    Lamb kabobs does it for me -- sooooo flavourful and juicy and tender!  Rice pilaf is nutty and underseasoned enough to compliment the meat entree.  Love the smoked salmon appetizer!  But stay away from the eggplant!  Very bitter and just...ick!    Dessert is something else...we had a brownie a la mode...the icecream and caramel was delicious..but the brownie was WAY too sweet.

Okay, so the first time I went was on a Saturday night. There was a bit of a wait, but after about 10 minutes we were seated on the front patio. It was a nice evening, so I was happy to sit outside. My only complaint, and it had NOTHING to do with Del Fuego, was that we were seated next to a large party of college guys who were loud and reacted with ""OH!!!!"" every time one of them said something. I could have done without that.  So, I ordered a house margarita and looked over the menu. The margarita came on the rocks and tasted fresh and had a lot of flavor. For the appetizer, we decided on the Queso Fundido con Chorizo Verde which is melted queso with meat and spinach served with small soft tortillas so that you can make little wraps. It was delicious and full of flavor with a nice mix of spices. For my entree, I decided on the Los Tres Hermanos Burrito (The Brothers Three) which came packed with pork, chicken, rice beans, guacamole and onions. The burrito was perfect and it was so good and a great deal at $9. We also had the chance to sample some tequilas, and while I am not a ""drink tequila straight"" type of person, I found it smooth with little to no ""after burn"".  When I went back, on a Tuesday, there was no wait at all and we were seated inside, which I think I prefer to sitting outside. We got the Ceviche which is gulf fish with tomatoes, jalapenos, lime, cilantro and tomatillos. It comes with hard chips for dipping. It was so good and so fresh. I honestly probably could have just eaten that and left happy. I liked the Tres Hermanos burrito so much the first time, that I got it on my second visit as well.   Shannon, one of the owners, was super accommodating  and made sure that we had everything we needed and that we were happy, the both times that I was there.

Let it be known that I dislike egg yolks, let alone barely cooked, but this dish was great. Artichoke pairs so nicely with egg. I surprised myself also by liking asparagus, a food that I was sure I despised. The crunch of the spears were still there and when combined with the Hollandaise sauce, it won me over.

I have to say that I was quite impressed. I have a sick obsession with pizza and its hard to find a good pie down south.

We ordered at the window and it took about 35 minutes until it was ready, but there was a bar next store so you can have a drink while you wait if you need to.

Sign isn't even up yet.  Board looks very similar to St.James Cheese company. I ordered the duck BLT - they cure their own meat It can be served any way but I ordered it pressed. It comes with a basket of what seemed to be fresh fried chips similar to the taro chips you would get at the store. Also tried the chocolate chip cookie and satsuma fizz drink.  My husband tried the mufaletta and our friend the ploughman's lunch. Tried to order the guava butter fries which they walked over to the main restaurant to do for me -very nice-but unfortunately only serve for dinner. Would definitely say mine was the best.   They have a bloody mary bar -spicy and regular - and their bloody mary mix looks tasty. The vodka they use looks like it's been marinting/infusing with a bunch of olives and peppers. Looking forward to come back and try this.  They have a couple different deli salads that look good. Their display case that faces the street does not look appetizing at all yet. Not sure if they can switch out for something but makes it look like a cafeteria.   A couple tables inside for seating.   Price is just a little bit more expensive than uptown, like a $1 more but to be expected in the quarter. Expect they'll get a big lunch crowd from the locals in the CBD who want a good sandwich.  Definitely a great sandwich place the quarter was in need of. You have butcher in the CBD, St.James Cheese company, Il Posto and Wayfare uptown but nothing really in the quarter and some days when you are down there you just want somewhere you can grab a quick good sandwich.

You order from the menu at the counter and seat yourself. I would expect a bit more extensive of a menu, but it is lacking somehow.    I had the French dip sandwich, my mother had the chicken salad sandwich, my father had half a chicken salad sandwich and the soup. They both enjoyed their meals. I found the French dip to be a bit salty.  You do get lovely views of the lake. The restaurant is neat, clean, and the service was nice. The waitress was quite lovely.",Restaurants

There were only two people working there, so I could see how it was easy thing to have happened.

We order 1 app for first service, and then 1 salad and 1 entree for dinner.  20 minutes later: we get the app.  And more water. Still no booze. 10 mintues later (mind you, this is THIRTY [30!!] minutes after we ordered it), booze arrives. 25 minutes later, entrees arrive. The only thing that happened quickly was getting the check.  2, FOOD Menu is very NOLA touristy, mixed with ""Carribean"" flair: po-boys, fried fried fried, jerk ___, etc. NOT vege friendly. Pescatarian (like me!) friendly, but you better be in the mood for fried. a. fried green tomatoes with prawn ($11) two small slices tomatoes, overly coated and good only if you peeled half the breading off. 1 giant prawn with no flavor to speak of. b. Caeasar salad ($7? $9?): standard lettuce and dressing (surprisingly underdressed, however). Nice touch: grape tomatoes. House made croutons: good flavor, too big for comfort.  c. Shrimp pasta ($17? something outrageous): TERRIBLE. Clearly cheap frozen shrimp (all 5? 6? of them), terrible sauce. BF couldn't even finish it. And he eats some crap, I tell you what.   3. Which brings me to COST. Standard NOLA tourist menu, with over exobitant prices. Charging me $2 more for my glass of wine than what was listed on the menu? HUGE mistake. That kinda stuff comes out of your tip.  Anyway: The bill was entirely too high for the quality of the food or the service. If it's going to cost me $60 for dinner for two, it better be edible, and I better have service that doesn't infuriate me.  4. Ambience: the courtyard is AMAZING. Pretty and quiet - you forget you're steps away from Frenchmen St. We happened to be there on one of the first fall nights after the long hot summer. So that was extra good. 80s music on the speakers: always good. Singer/songwriter/guitarist who started playing midway though: eh.   Verdict: I wouldn't go again. Even if someone else was paying.   I know they're somewhat new, so I hope the service, kitchen timing, and menu/bill $$ discrepencies get worked out as they continue to operate.  However, time is not going fix that food. Not without using better ingredients and making sure it isn't so overpriced for what you're getting.",Restaurants

I must say, I liked the sauce on the Seafood Roll, and the amount of seafood found in the roll was surprising.  I am happy I tried it.    Now for the French Toast.  I am typically don't like french toast but, the online reviews made me curious enough to try.  The French toast was fantastic.  I prematurely poured a minimal amount of syrup on my toast before tasting the french toast.  That was a mistake; because after taking a bite, I realized I did not need to add anything to this masterpiece of flavor and sweetness.  Imagine that.  French toast made using French bread (who knew?  I think I need to get out more :) ).  It was so soft, flavorful,  and oh so sweet.  In my opinion, adding syrup to this dish was an insult and should have never been put on the table.   I took a slight issue with my scrambled eggs because I thought they were a bit salty. However, I think it's just me because I am sensitive to salt in my food.    Excellent customer service and the music playlist was spot-on.

It was during Mardi Gras and we had a peacock theme. The wedding was held at Broussard's restaurant in their courtyard which is already a beautiful space in and of itself. But what Shane did to the courtyard was simply like a fairytale. The conditions and constraints he had to work in due to the Mardi Gras festival and all the road closures and whatnots did not make this an easy event for him. He rolled with it all flawlessly.  In our initial consult many months ago back in April, we outlined a vision. We asked for blues and greens, whimsy and romance but in a way that did not detract from an already beautiful outdoor setting. What he gave us was blues and greens, feathers and bling tastefully placed everywhere with lots and lots of candles and romantic touches. He nailed our vision and delivered in spades.   I will say that we had a lot of unique touches and requests to include with our wedding and shipped several boxes of things down for Shane to place and include in our overall design. He nailed them perfectly and when I walked in and saw everything from our time capsule to our crazy hand made arts and crafts guest book table all so perfectly displayed I breathed a sigh of relief. It's a little nerve wracking to have a destination wedding (we are from the West Coast) and wonder will the end product really reflect my vision... It did!   And then I will say about the lighting... About two weeks before my photographer realized there wouldn't be enough lighting to provide for good photos. I contacted Shane in a panic and he handled the last minute freak out with skill and calmness. I know this may make me seem either neurotic or a bridezilla, which I'm neither... But I digress... He contracted for lights, coordinated with my photographer and brought it in on budget. Thank heavens for contingency budgets.   Job well done Plant Gallery and thank you!",Shopping

The recently renovated W has a small, but inviting outdoor swimming pool which is located within a quaint and secluded courtyard. The area is adorned with a fountain, benches, a palm & beautifully shaped shade tree, as well as, two large cabanas. The room itself is a bit tight, but has a futuristic and clean design that adds a bit of a wow factor while differentiating itself from others.

765,For Your Eyes Only 20/20,29.9208411,-90.0997198,16.0,"I recently had a very frustrating experience with For Your Eyes Only 20/20. I first visited the office in September and had an overall pleasant experience (why I gave 2 stars instead of 1). They did their best in finding me the right contacts and prescription for my eyes. When I called six months later to reorder my contacts...this is where the frustration came in. I called on a Wednesday and was told someone would pull my chart and call me right back. I waited all morning and did not receive a call. When I called back in the afternoon, I was told the same thing.   I called a few days later (after never receiving a call) and was put on hold for so long that the line hung up on me.  I called back, told them what I wanted and that I was using my insurance. There was some kind of confusion on their part and they told me my insurance would not cover the contacts. I knew something was wrong and told them I would get in contact with my HR/insurance. After checking, I called them back and told them they needed to look into it because I was fully covered. They then realized no one had ever updated my chart with my most recent contacts. After we finally got everything figured out, the order was placed and I was told I would have them the next week.   After not hearing back for over a week, I called the office and was put on hold. Once again I was on hold for so long the line hung up on me. I called back and had to explain all over again that I wanted to know the status on my order...I was on the phone for 20 minutes...majority of which was on hold. I was told they had my contacts, but they just forgot to call me.   When I first ordered my contacts, I was also told I could get a rebate. When I picked up the contacts, I asked about the rebate and they gave me the information. After reading it over, I realized I did not even qualify for the rebate since I was just re-ordering contacts and had not had an eye exam.   Overall, this was a painfully frustrating experience.

K and I were hungry and it was getting late, so I was trying to find a place that was open late. I searched for ""dinner"" in the Yelp search box and selected a couple of neighborhoods. I was scrolling down quickly and saw that La Crepe Nanou was going to be open till 11 p.m. This was the winner.  We parked not far from the place and walked over. It was a beautiful night. There was a cat lazily lounging about on the host's table/podium thing right by the door. There was a couple waiting before us when we walked up, but we were all seated promptly.  K's allergic to shellfish so that ruled a lot of menu items out for us, but we still managed to enjoy an awesome dinner. We shared the Crepe au Poulet to start with. We got some Pinot Gris to go with it. Our server warned us that the Pinot Gris was a little sweet. It was really sweet, but I (and K, too) like my alcohol sweet, so it worked out for us. The best part of the Crepe au Poulet was the Ratatouille, which we got on the side (I don't know how it normally comes). I just wanted to sit with a big bowl of that Ratatouille by a fireplace. It felt like home, because it reminded me of my host mom in Paris, who used to make us a big pot of Ratatouille about once a week.  Then I had the Duck (special) and K had the veal with tomato sauce. Honestly by this time I was getting really full, so I only had a little bit of my duck, which was really good. But I'm not good at the whole fork-and-knife thing when bones are involved (my French host parents used to tell me to just use my hands when I'd struggle at the table), so I gladly took most of it in a to-go box so I can go home and pick up the meat with my hands. The grilled veggies that it came with were also very good. K enjoyed his veal, as was witnessed by his clean plate.  We didn't have room for dessert, which was a shame because I really want to try the crepe with the Creme de Marrons.  I'm definitely gonna have to go back to try the mussels and the Crepe Marrons.

Don't go here for food!!! Horrible experience. If I could give zero stars I would!  We were seated at a table near the live band. Our host asked a busboy to come wipe our table off. When the busboy showed up he goes it looks clean to me and walked away without even wiping it down or emptying the overflowing astray on the table. Shortly after our waiter shows up and tries to get a drink order from us. They are out of so many things he said if we wanted liquor or beer it would be better for us to go to the bar. At the bar I can see plastic cups covering 75% of the beer bottles which is the universal indication they are out of those items.  Then we ask about the menu, which is small in itself and has no explanation of what anything is. Several of the items list they are only available on Friday. Then the server rattles off some other items that aren't available including the boiled seafood which is listed as that nights special. So the extremely limited menu just got cut down to 5 items to choose from and when we asked for an explanation the server didn't know what anything was or how it was prepared. The menu pictured on the business pictures here is not what we were given - it was a version that didn't even have all of that!  At that point we decided to get up and go elsewhere.

You can definitely tell they're short staffed based on wait times, and not having full menu offerings, but overall they seem very happy to accommodate or make alternative suggestions.  They do have valet in the hotel for easy parking. You can wait a little while if they're busy, but they were very careful with all the vehicles and all very nice. It's not the easiest place to park, so I appreciate the valet option.   The band was great though not who I would expect to be playing in that venue I guess; I thought more bebop or contemporary Jazz for this space. Duke's band was playing more swing style, but of course, no one was dancing, so it was a bit odd. There wasn't much of a crowd so they took a rather long break in the middle of the set. I don't blame them, but there was a $10 cover charge so after a while it was annoying.   The staff is top notch, even during these odd pandemic times of shortages. A staff member offered to walk us directly into The Blue Dog, and once inside the bar tender checked our vaccine card and tickets, handed us some menus, told us we could have a seat and she'd be around for our orders soon. She made a few drinks for those that came in before us, and it wasn't long before she was around to take our order. We ordered their cheese plate and pretzel dish along with two drinks. What my guest wanted couldn't be made because they were out of one of the mixers, but the bartender offered something else and he was happy with what she made. I went with wine, and had a good pour for the price. The food was over priced for what was served, so I'd skip that if you go. They couldn't find crackers for our cheese plate for a good 15 minutes, but two staff members stopped by to let us know they were working on it and apologized for the delay - and they eventually brought us crackers. Kudos to the staff again.   I appreciated their extra level of service for something as mundane as crackers, and how nice everyone in the hotel was overall. I'll definitely recommend this place based on service to my tourist friends. For a night at a jazz club though it ended up being a bit pricey with parking, drinks, food, and cover charge. If you're already in the area or staying at the hotel, and you've grabbed food elsewhere, $10 cover per person plus one drink each isn't all too bad.   Small complaint - the doorman had the door open - I know it's a New Orleanian thing so people hear the music and want to pay to come inside - but it was the first night the temps dropped, and no one was really prepared for that door to be open. If it's a cold night, bring a jacket and be prepared to keep it on all night. That was my only real complaint, was them keeping the door open and making it cold.",Nightlife

I am not a cigar connoisseur by any means, but I do know a labor of love when I see it.  You can see the look on the rollers faces as the very delicately roll each cigar and place it onto a rack for ageing.  Each cigar type will have a unique ""smoke"" depending on multiple factors including the type of tobacco used.  As I am a novice in cigar selection I asked one of the shop workers to assist in picking something that would allow me to enjoy the experience.  He was not only very polite but excited to give me a crash course on the subject.  He took me into the humidor where they had both the cigars that were aging and not yet for sale as well as those that could be purchased and smoked.  The general rule is that the flavor of a cigar will continue to improve for up to ten years  However most cigars will be aged for 3 months to a couple of years.

I called at 11:30am to make sure that they had it in stock, and I told them I would be there today. I walked in the pouring rain from Canal Place to Fleurty Girl, only to find out they were closed due to bad weather, which wouldn't have been a problem, except I could see the cashier sitting eating at her desk. Assuming it was the person I had spoken to, and keeping in mind it was just after they had closed, I was hoping she could let me in to pay for the Water Meter Mat that I was looking for. I knocked, and she looked up at me, and continued to eat. I then called the store, which she looked at me, while she ignored the call. I was frustrated, so I started to walk back to my car. She came, opened the door, and said ""we're closed due to bad weather.""  To which I responded ""I'm the one who called earlier about the Water Meter Mat."" To which she responded with an amazing attitude about how she couldn't help me and ""the ONLY reason she even answered the door was because she could see me calling"", and when I suggested she was being quite rude considering I walked in the pouring rain, she said ""I'm not being rude. I'm gonna not be rude now."" and slammed the door.

The server brought me a large pizza, heaped with 5 toppings. The crust was just the right combination of thick/thin and crisp/soft. The sauce was tangy and spicy enough to compliment the generous amount of cheese and incredibly fresh toppings. This pizza renewed my faith in New Orleans food.

As a graduate student, I didn't feel like I could afford any of the gorgeous pieces they sold, but I sure wanted them. When I graduated with a Master's Degree in 1992, my parents bought me one of their beautiful wooden clipboards with which to begin my career as a psychologist. I have used that clipboard every working day since - almost 25 years - and I still love it. I keep thinking that any day it's going to break and I'll need to buy a new one, but so far, so good. I know now that although I couldn't afford it in 1992, the price was, in no way, too high, not for the workmanship and longevity of the item. Some years after 1992, I also bought myself a mini wooden clipboard to use for small items around the house, since now I was a gainfully employed member of society. Since I only use that one infrequently, I imagine it will be available for me to pass on to 2-3 generations beneath me. Outstanding work. Well, well, well worth the price.

In my search of the Southeast Louisiana for a good wing, it took a number of years before I found Finger Lick'n Wings.  While they are not quite as good as those in the Wing Motherland, they are the best around.  I have been going to this wing joint for years, and tried just about all the sauces.  My personal favorites include the Obama, St. Torcha, Mardi Gras, and Who Dat.  Just to note - they carry a huge selection of sauces, and are sure to have something that suits your fancy.  As far as the wings themselves, they are larger than the typical wing served around here, and are actually cooked correctly - which is apparently surprisingly difficult here in New Orleans.    Of of the time of this review, it appears that they are renovating the inside and painting the outside - I'll update if necessary.  They are mostly a takeout-based joint right now, but are trying to move to a dine-iin restaurant.  They are also pursuing a liquor license for the location.  I believe they has Barbecue on the menu for a while (around Mardi Gras), but I'm not sure the chef brought in to do it is still around.  Every time I visit something changes, usually for better.  On the downside (which is from a wing purist standpoint) they do not serve Bleu Cheese and Celery with the wings - the big strike keeping them from hitting five stars.  I cannot speak for the other food on the menu, since I stick with the wings.  If you're in the neighborhood, stop by and grab some wings Buck or Troy - you won't be disappointed!",Restaurants

Back in the day before Katrina i visited the local strip clubs on a regular basses. I hate going to French Quarter they are over priced and just overall suck. Visions is nearly all locals, and secluded enough to feel comfortable. There parking lot is huge and well lighted and have security that not only watch the front doors but watch over the parking lot. Good not to worry some crack head or a hole is breaking into my car while i am watching some boobs. Back in the day they had stools so they were comfortable, but they decided to replace them with fixed chairs that don't swivel so your forced to either stand or sit facing the bar. I understand why they choose to fix the chairs to not move many guys would just sit there with there backs to the girls taking up valuable space. But the chairs are not the most comfortable. They added two more lap dance rooms, one is more private then the old open room that had  4 to 8 girls giving lap dances at one time. Not sure about the VIP one but many smiles came out from that one. They fixed up the bathroom, feels like a luxury hotel men's room. The time before last they had a guy working in there but nobody this last time.  Drinks are ok, usually $5 per mix or beer, The mix drinks are a little small and week for me but i like to drink. The bartenders are usually pretty cool and remember your face and which drink you want and get it to you pretty fast. As to the girls ( The main reason your there ) it varies like every other strip club. You will see the hot ones the not so hot ones, the sexy ones and the trashy ones. Best way to describe "" to each his own is beautiful"". I never felt pressured to get lap dances or buy ( Warm Shots ) from the shot girls. Overall i think this strip club is the best one around because you can feel comfortable, have a good time, not spend your entire paycheck, and go home safe feeling you had a good time.

First it was difficult to park and we paid over 30.00 to park in a ground lot near the restaurant. I never mind price if the experience and food are good. However this far from good..it was horrible. The floor in the restaurant is tilted and felt like we were sliding toward the wall. The place is loud and not comfortable. Such an acclaimed place and drinks were poor at best. When asked about simple syrup or bar sweetener they said they did not have any. Then we asked for orange juice to help the drink out and they told us they had no orange juice? Strange for a bar to not have such mainstays. The small plates or appetizer sounded interesting. That's not quite what I'd call them. The tuna was underwhelming and very small. The crawfish dish was the best of the 4 we ordered. The rest were strange and had numerous spices that clashed. Then we order dinner plates. The barbecued shrimp and grits was the best of the lot. The fish tasted spiked and the steak was over cooked. Sorry to report the dessert did not redeem the meal. It was good but not great. We had cheesecake, the pie and chocolate bar. The bathroom was limited as well to one while we were there... one wasn't working. The server tried very hard and couldn't have been nicer. But the service was so slow and took 2.5 hours to finish (and we returned two of the meals). To insult to injury, they asked us to move to the bar because they needed the table for the next guests. Restaurant 101 was violated and never would I have dreamed to ask that of the patrons to move while paying the bill and using the bathroom... much less after a terrible experience.

I'm friends with the owners of this place and they generally keep things running pretty well here.  The main thing that gives me the ""blues"" about this juke joint is that some of the bartenders here are sometimes not my favorite as they seem unable to handle large crowds well and can be painfully slow while they also have some other bartenders that just seem to always be slow.  If it wasn't for the inconsistent to occasionally poor service this would be a four start joint.  They are still a pretty new establishment so they are still breaking in the staff so with time I would expect the service to improve.    I would come here more often except for its location, as I don't hang out in the Warehouse District that much, and parking is never easy in the area.  If you're looking to book a private party or event this is certainly a nice venue to check out.  As far as just hanging out here as a bar it is usually more fun on nights when they have a good band and they generally keep a pretty full music schedule.

My eating schedule was already jammed packed but I somehow made a little room for this spot. How could I not? It's like being in Seattle Washington and not trying out the original Starbucks despite being mere steps away.  Unlike the original Starbucks that started it all though which kept it's original historic decor and logo, this place have disappointingly modernized the interior and would not look out of place at any other location in the US. There is no sense of history in it.  Despite that, I read through multiple reviews that Popeye's taste different and even better than what is to be found elsewhere in the US because of the difference in spice that they use.  This I found to be true although for me it wasn't as big a difference as I had assumed.  Seems more tender and moist than my last few experience with the chain too. Would I go out of my way to eat here if I knew and was further away? Nope. Lucky I didn't have to. I would rate the flavor only slightly above what I would rate a regular Popeyes. A 3.5 instead of 3   The ordering system at this location is bizarre. They have two separate lines for taking the order at the back. Then you go on another line further down to pay at a register. Then if you want condiments or take it out, you have to take it to the center of the restaurant much further away so they could do those things for you.  And I have never used ghetto on a review thus far so this would be my first. Some of the people, including the management acts kind of ghetto. Just being on line  once I have already seen the person taking the order being rude and disrespecting the person in front of me. Then I saw said person be sent to the back because she was being rude to both the customer and the manager. Then when the manager took over the ordering when I was next, she made this comment when I ordered a spicy chicken instead of the regular one. ""Well, we are closed so we don't have any more spicey chickens."" Then stared at me. I was ok not having spicey since I did get there near closing time but it was strange to have attitude thrown my way for innocently ordering something I didn't know they ran out of.  While eating, I had also seen the workers gathering and just joking with each other about some of the events that just happen, not caring who is within earshot.   I took no point out for that but I assume some of the people coming here might want to be forewarned of this just in case.  Now I could scratch off going to the original Popeyes off my bucket list.

And service was great, helpful with flavor suggestions and labelling.  Gave 4 of 5 stars because maybe they could benefit from one more equally gracious staff person.",Restaurants
727,Ugly Dog Saloon & BBQ,29.9425511,-90.067852,17.0,"Went here today with two others after every other restaurant had an hour or long wait. I wish we had waited an hour.  We walked in to a dive. Fine. Ugly is on the name. What can be expected? Some toddler was banging on a piano by the entrance. After having to go to the bar to order, I asked the bartender what she recommended. She said ""anything."" To narrow it down, I asked which of the sandwiches. Again...""anything."" Oooookay. I'll have a burger cooked medium-well with only lettuce and cheddar. I asked for fries instead of chips. ""We don't have a fryer."" The other two got ""Today's Special"": a chili dog. Theirs came out in a couple minutes.   After twenty minutes, I went up to the area where you go to pick your food. I then saw three microwaves. No sign of a grill. Just three microwaves and a smoker. I watched them microwave not only the hot dogs, but also my macaroni and cheese, some person's chick breast, sausage, the chili, some cheese sauce, a bottles bbq sauce, and my hamburger. They then proceeded to put some sort of cole slaw, pepper jack cheese, and other things on my burger. I told them I only asked for lettuce and cheese but to now just trade it for a chili dog. The man said that the hot dogs take some time to grill so it will be a while. Oh, like the twenty minutes it took you to microwave the burger?   The chili dog came out about 5-10 minutes later. Chili tasted like it was from a can. Hot dog had no grill marks but was a Nathan's hot dog, so it's hard to screw up.   Bathroom was disgustingly dirty. Toilet was overflowed and soap dispenser was empty.   Stay away.",Restaurants
962,Nacho Mama's Mexican Grill,29.923299,-90.087423,18.0,"It's hard to know where to start on this review because our experience went from bad to worse.  I don't ever go to Nacho Mama's expecting five star cuisine - in fact, I am mainly there for the queso dip.  However, two weeks ago my husband and I went to Elmwood and had what may have been the best fish taco I've ever had and I was craving one, but trying to stay local.  Hence our visit to Magazine.  I ordered a 'rita; my husband a mojito.  They had to ""find"" some mint -  which it looked like they might have found in a pond.  Lots of slimy black floaties.  I returned that drink to the bar and trade it in on a 'rita.  Stuff happens, right?  Okay... We order our meals.  Fish tacos for the adults and a steak taco for our daughter.  Oh, and the aforementioned queso.  Chips and queso arrive after a reminder to our waitress.  The chips are greasy.  But I'm hungry, so I let it go.  Well, until I notice that the chip in my hand is greasy and *hairy*.  Sweet baby king cake Jesus.  Having waited tables, I can overlook a lot, but hair in food is a non-negotiable for me.  But I did instinctively flick it away and threw the offending chip to the floor.  I then removed the chips from play.  About that same time, our food arrived.  Have I mentioned we'd been there quite awhile?  Anyway, the tacos come wrapped in paper.  Oh good!  Yummy fish tacos at long last!  I unwrap mine and it's a) warmer than ice cold but colder than room temperature.  It's a temperature that cannot be blamed on the waitstaff.  This is simply a preparation issue.  My husband's are cold and so is my daughter's steak taco.  To their credit, although the rice was also stone cold, the black beans were nuclear hot.  And probably nuked, come to think of it.  Oh, and did I mention that my fish taco is some putrid pink/brown color.  Like Fancy Feast, but now with capers!  I should also mention that at this point I have forbidden everyone at the table from eating *anything* else.  But our waitperson is now MIA.  So I have to enlist another staffer to get the manager.  I do have to say that the manager handled everything well-  comped everything and offered to buy us dinner, but at that point...well, it's going to be awhile before I am ready to venture in again.  We ended up down Magazine at Rum House (which also seemed to be having an off night, but not so off as to risk people's health and well-being).",Restaurants

This was the only close place to where we were staying in Gentilly, and he is into the fast food crap. I couldn't understand how eating fast food would help with his sickness but anyway...  The line was to the door of this small Church's.  Loud yapping from large women with several children combined with fried chicken smells filled the air.  When I finally got to the cashier, behind ceiling to floor bullet proof glass, I went to place my order. ""I'll have the number 4 to go."" I was instantly responded to with a sharp ""We outta dat.""  Oh, ""I'll have the number 7 then.""  Once again ""We out.""  I kindly inquired what they did have, only to be given a fiery look. Ultimately Joyanna (real name) was able to make me the number 4, because she suddenly realized they were in fact, not out of the chicken pieces.    I paid, took my receipt and moved down the line back to the abyss of screaming women on cell phones and crying children.  Suddenly an argument broke out between two large black women over whose order should have been done first.   It truly was like a scene out of Madea meets Rasputia.    After 15 minutes had gone by and still no order, I inquired to one of the kitchen staff as to the length of time it would be until my one single order was ready.  Scott, who seemed to be high, told me, ""I dun know.""

Last time I was there two huge unleashed dogs blocked the way to the bathroom so I had to go outside and around to another door in order to get to the bathroom!!  Leave your giant dogs at home. Who thinks their dog wants to spend hours in a bar?  I have even seen them there during Saints games when the bar is packed.  It's just stupid! Next I have to rant about the new owner.  He exemplifies the word douche.  Every time i have seen him in his bar he is trashed!  He is not a fun friendly drunk he is down right belligerent!  I have seen him yell at the bartenders in front of a crowded bar.  He makes no attempt to meet the patrons of the bar which I think is bad business.

As I approach the counter I see a sign taped to the debit card swipe machine but the sign has flipped backwards and cannot be seen from a distance. So, I stood in the short line and finally when it was my turn I had to pretty much lift the sign up in order to read it because it was not visible otherwise. The sign of course said NO CASH BACK. At this point I was slightly annoyed because why not!!!  So I asked the person working and she said she would be able to give me $20. Well when I went to swipe my card the option for up to $40 came up and I almost allowed my finger to press it but I didn't. I just go $20.   I'm not sure why this CVS is making up it's own rules about giving cash back. It seems as though the CVS policy is to allow up to $40. But to just put up a sign to dissuade people from getting cash back makes me more than bothered. There are no banks in the immediate area and there are no other options except going into the grocery store that shares the parking lot.

Chef Elon Shaya and the entire Miss River team have created a flavorful New Orleans menu and thoughtful craft cocktails.   We started with the New Orleans Rum punch, which was equally balanced in flavor, sweetness, and strength. As a result, we each enjoyed two of these cocktails!  Our meal included: Crab au gratin, Whole carved buttermilk fried chicken with sauces, red beans and rice, and baked sweet potato.   The crab au gratin was my least favorite item. It was good, but quite an expensive appetizer. While the crab meat itself was sweet, succulent, and fresh, the serving size (approximately 6 ounces) for $18 was a bit rich. Also, the au gratin topping was appropriately toasted but the entire dish lacked flavor/seasoning and a binding component (i.e., creaminess).  The Whole carved buttermilk fried chicken is a show-stopper! The crust is crunchy and flavorful, the meat is tender, and the overall presentation is magnificent! The staff initially serves the chicken whole, for purposes of presentation. Immediately thereafter, it is whisked away to the carving station. By the time the pieces of chicken return, resting deliciously on a bed of rosemary, the accompanying sauces are there at the table waiting. There are three sauces, which are seasoned honey, crunchy red pepper, and a green herbs. Each of the sauces provided their own flavor, from sweet to spicy to pungent. Truly, the chicken was so perfectly seasoned that the sauces were not required, but they did add to the overall chicken experience.  The whole carved buttermilk fried chicken is an a la carte item, so we chose red beans and rice and baked sweet potato as accompaniments. The baked sweet potato was classic and delicious. The red beans and rice dish was well-seasoned and spicy. The red beans may be too spicy for non-Orleanians but a nice complement to the chicken. Plus, the rice was cooked perfectly!  The sweet end to the meal was lagniappe from the staff! While my specific recollection may be slightly amiss, the two different treats were chocolate chicory cookies and banana pralines.

There is a small bar on the ground floor, with a small space for seating. There is a bar upstairs with a bit more seating but it's nothing special. The bartender upstairs seemed more interested in talking to his friends than he was in making cocktails for his paying customers.  You should know that there is no access to the balcony on the corner via the bar. That's all part of the Bourbon Orleans Hotel and can only be accessed through the rooms of the hotel's guests. You'll see Sister Roma of the SF chapter of Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence up there with porn stars during Decadence, but there is no way for us plebeians to join them ... unless we are invited.

1506,The Velvet Cactus,30.004879499999998,-90.1029873,17.0,"Stopped by for a late lunch and fortunately could order the Saturday -Sunday only brunch offerings which are available till 2 pm (the menu says 3). Our timing also meant parking was abundant  even though we live only 2 blocks away. Due to the threat of rain as noted by The Weather Channel, we chose to eat inside instead of the tree shade covers patio.    The MOJO Pulled pork is one of those brunch offerings and is very, very good. This selection is an ample serving of well shredded pork loaded with smoky flavor (and an subtle suggestion of black pepper).  Nice and moist and served on grilled toast.   It is topped with 2 poached eggs -soft yokes and firm whites- and the flavors meld very well. The selection is served with a hearty sized portion of cheese grits and potatoes.  My wife chose the Mexican Scramble, also a weekend brunch only selection, which obviously was centered on scrambled eggs but incorporated saut√©ed onions, red, and green peppers. It likewise came with home fries and the tasty cheese grits. She was pleased with the traditional blend of Mexican spices. Flavor without the machismo heat.   There is always a wide selection of mixed drinks, beers, and wines. My choice today was Abita's AndyGator. Tried and true liquid muscle relaxant especially if you are not driving.",Restaurants

While it isn't really my style, I went back with my mom because she liked their style. I believe most of the pictures and the coordinating shirts, mugs, lithographs, etc. is from one artist. Again, their style isn't something I like so I didn't pay much attention. They also carry voodoo dolls that look like beanie babies than scary looking figure made out of hair.   One thing that did caught my eye was a lithograph that the artist made for the local band Bonnerama. They are a really good band and I was surprised that they were selling something like that to tourist. I find out that the artist is friends with the band member and they did their album cover for them. That's pretty cool but it didn't persuade me to buy anything.   But my mother did buy some some lithographs...or maybe they were postcards. Anyway, she really liked the pictures with the different smiling cats as they looked like the one from Alice in Wonderland.   They also have an adjoining building where you can look at original pieces but I didn't take a look because they probably cost thousands of dollars that I don't have.  Overall, your mom will like this store. So take her over here when she comes to visit. Or if you are a tourist looking for something classy that isn't all that expensive.",Shopping

It still somewhat has the feel of that old bowling alley but with a sports-bar twist. As you step inside, you get lost in the pure sight of the establishment. A stage to the right, a fully-stocked bar to the left, and a gazillion pool tables in front of you, you know that you're going to have a fun time. There are screen-porch-esque ping pong table rooms and dart boards all the way in the back. It's just as big as the old bowling alley (they didn't build any walls or anything), and it'll blow you away. This place is definitely for the bar gamer. They have a great selection of drinks and a bomb-ass ladies' room (lounge included). I'm giving Shamrock only 4-stars because it was a little overwhelming for me. I'm more of a ""chill-out at a table and talk with friends"" kind of bar goer, but that doesn't mean other people like me won't like this place.

I love the ""subway"" style way of choosing toppings.  I wish I could say I liked the burger more, but I just didn't.  I chose the Lamb burger on Brioche with feta, cucumber, mixed greens, green onions and garlic aioli.  The flavor combination was good, but the burger meat was dry, crumbly and a little less flavorful than I would like.  I suppose that's the steam effect.  I also wish they offered some ""specialty burger"" ideas.  The topping options are overwhelming and I feel like I could have used a guide.  Honestly, there was no way to know what some of them were without asking.  Fortunately the counter people were friendly, helpful and reassuring about my choices.  Although, I get the feeling they are not particularly foodies, but college kids who could be anywhere.    It's also a little pricy for what it is.  I paid $12 for just a burger, no side or drink.  But I will go back.  I like that it's a healthier option and that there are so many combination choices.  Next time I'll try a beef burger and creamier cheese.  The salmon looks appealing too (although even more expensive).  I'm hoping with a little time and tweaking the burger flavor/consistency will improve.",Restaurants
